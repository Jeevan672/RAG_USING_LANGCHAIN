How do you get the most out of people while being a great employer? How do you deal with performance reviews, salary changes, learning and development, recruitment, giving and getting feedback, hiring and firing?  \\nBlendle has a mission to make quality journalism more accessible. In the last three years, we've built the HR operation at Blendle from scratch. We've tried to answer the most pressing questions. We learned through trial and error.  \\nIt has struck me how little information companies share publicly about their people operations. We would all gain a lot by being more open about what works well and what doesn't.  \\nThat's why we decided to make Blendle's Employee Handbook publicly accessible. You can find the result of three years of hard work here.  \\nWhen I pressed 'publish public' I got a sense of why there is so little practical information about this topic out there. It's pretty scary to just publish it. So, here's an instant disclaimer: this is a living document, it's not perfect and we'll improve it. Still, I hope that more companies will press the 'publish public'-button. I hope that *together* we can take the concept of 'working' to the next level. So: have fun reading. Copy as much as you'd like. And please provide us with feedback at hr@blendle.com\", metadata={'Header 1': 'Work at Blendle'}),\n",

A lot of males and a lot of white. We know that we need to do better to make Blendle a more diverse workplace. We spend a lot of time thinking about diversity and inclusion. After reading, talking and listening, we learned a few things:  \\n- This is a sensitive topic: feelings and opinions are involved.\\n- This is a trending topic: there is a lot of noise and it\\'s hard to pin down the essence.\\n- This is not a new, but renewed topic.\\n- Diversity and inclusion is more of a scale than a simple yes or no statement.\\n- Everyone is biased and every company is at risk of becoming less diverse and inclusive.\\n- A more diverse and inclusive company **>** a less diverse and inclusive company for a lot of reasons.\\n- Diversity and inclusion is not \\'just\\' about gender or race, so looking at just those numbers can limit your thoughts on this topic. The practical side of this topic is also way more subtle.  \\n**Diversity and inclusion at Blendle**  \\nWhat we know now:  \\n- We believe in the importance of a **diverse** team because we believe **it\\'s crucial to our succes and product.** We try to add meaning to peoples everyday life by helping them reach quality content instead of cat gifs on Facebook. This can only be done by a group of people with different backgrounds, expertise, personalities, talents, ideas and opinions.\\n- We believe being **inclusive** is important because it **fits our core values** of wanting to be a great place to work and really caring for each other. A place where people feel welcome and can be themselves. Inclusivity is crucial to our work environment and culture.\\n- We have trouble hiring diverse profiles. We noticed no flaws in the hiring process which would lead to favour a certain type of profile. We did notice that the \\'pools\\' in which we are hiring (journalism and tech) are dominated by a certain profile which could explain this trend.\\n- We have open-minded people at Blendle who are willing and are becoming more aware.  \\n**Some observations**:  \\n- We tend to speak in Dutch in social settings. It can easily make non-Dutch people uncomfortable. We should speak English.\\n- The way we work (especially in meetings) suits extravert people better then introvert people.\\n- There is not a lot of variation on standard diversity variables like political views, religion, age, ethnicity, gender and educational background. Again, partly explained by the field we\\'re in.\\n- Most of the leaders at Blendle are male.\\n- There is equal pay between men and women in the same role.\\n- We believe aiming for diversity numbers narrows the conversation on the topic for now. We decided to use the data to feed the conversation but not implement quotas.  \\n**What we do:**  \\n- Fight bias in hiring. For example by not asking for a resume when people apply, but asking questions related to the actual job. This way the first judgement is based on relevant information, not on age or a picture.\\n- Emphasize the fact that we would like more diverse profiles to reply on our job postings by adding it to our vacancies. In Dutch: *\"Niet onbelangrijk: we vinden diversiteit belangrijk, dus laat je alsjeblieft niet tegenhouden om te solliciteren als je anders denkt of er anders uitziet. Dat vinden we juist mooi.\"* And in English: *\"Final remark: we think it\\'s important to have a diverse workforce, so please don\\'t hesitate to apply if you think or look differently. We actually like that.\"*\\n- Track the basic data.\\n- Guard equal pay.\\n- Actively source diverse profiles.\\n- Internal campaign for speaking English, sources for more diverse pipelines with hiring, make this a recurring topic on the HR agenda.  \\n**Homework**  \\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79JHMjA6tAA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79JHMjA6tAA)  \\n[Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter?referral=00563)  \\n[Why diversity matters](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters)  \\n[Employee Diversity in tech](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5jevLJTK9Aayob2msk4Ss9qIMCqfris4m_m0kXO-7s/edit#gid=1925490147)  \\n[re:Work - Guide: Raise awareness about unconscious bias](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/unbiasing-raise-awareness/steps/give-your-own-unbiasing-workshop/)  \\n[Take a Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)  \\n---  \\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

Putting our set of values or our way of life in writing wasn\\'t an easy task. Mainly because the moment we started putting this in writing, it already altered.

We shared that with the whole group, got some good feedback and slimmed it down to 8 slick posters.

Give actionable feedback and try to come up with concrete points to work on in his/her personal goals. Don't wait for the feedback cycle, the time is always now.\\n- Someone **stopped growing or learning**. This isn't necessarily an immediate problem, but it can be because most people like working at Blendle because they grow and learn so much. Someone standing still for a year is a red flag.\\n- Someone's **role is no longer a match**. Roles, jobs and their demands change. They aren't static. Pay attention to changing roles and put effort into telling your people what changed instead of implicitly expecting people to understand what changed. A changing role can be a reason for someone to no longer be the perfect match. Tell someone what we expect from them, make it clear. Work together to match those new demands but be honest if it doesn't work.  \\nThis also works the other way around: some roles don't change, but people do.  \\n- Someone wants to **grow in a different direction**. Blendle is still a small company so we can't just offer every possible career path. Use 1 on 1's to talk about someone's ambition and career path. Be honest and realistic about the possibilities at Blendle. Think about whether you think someone would be a good fit for that role and tell them what would be needed to get to that point (in terms of skills, expertise, personality, experience). The next question is whether Blendle has a role like that vacant. Be realistic and open about this.\\n- Someone **believes in a different direction for the company or the team**. Everybody is really invested on an abstract level. We get out of bed every morning because we believe in what we are doing. That belief might shift and that is okay, as long as we talk about it. If you notice someone losing belief and probably disagreeing with everything that happens, that is a red flag.\\n- **Time is up.** Sometimes it's this simple. People grow, evolve, change, Blendle does the same. People have the tendency to go for what they know. We believe it's very healthy to move on after a while, before the milk turns sour.\\n5. Try to **fix** it together. Come up with a plan to improve the situation. Put a plan in motion and keep giving feedback.\\n6. **Finish it up** on time if the situation is not progressing.

       " Document(page_content=\"Goal: both short and long term. Get people in who are a match according to us.  \\nSourcing is our most important way to get people in. Sourcing is every way of proactively asking people - who we find interesting - if they are interested in working with us. This mainly happens online and can really be an art. The days of just Linkedin inmails are over, we have to be more creative.  \\n**Important:** We only use candidate info that is publicly available when sourcing. If we reach out to candidates we mention where we found them and where we got there contact info. We rely on legit interest when we reach out, but delete all data when a candidate is unresponsive or not interested. We only source candidates after a hiring team reviewed the profile, so reaching out is always a serious invitation for a cup of coffee.  \\nSourcing is practically always part of the hiring strategy because it's the fastest way to get quality people in. Some pointers:  \\n- **Do it for every job.** Also for jobs that get a lot of applicants (like the editorial positions). We recommend everybody to use sourcing.\\n- **Source to pin down your profile.** New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. You make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, aks your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.\\n- **Always start with sourcing.** Mainly because it takes time and it takes more steps than an applicant who is ready to go. So don't wait until you notice you don't have enough good people coming in. Start with it.  \\n**How**  \\nAs said, sourcing is an art. So leave the black belt sourcing hacking shizzle to Sjamilla. She will help and advise you in the process. What you can do now is think about these different groups and ask yourself if you know (or know people who know) good people.  \\nChannels  \\n- **Network**  \\nThe fastest and best hires come from our network. From people you know, who know people (who know people…). You get it ;). Also actively ask people you think are great to share the job post or intro a few people that would be a good match.  \\n- **Community**  \\nThis might look the same as your network but it isn’t. Everybody is part of different types of community. Private communities: church, scouting, soccer, Ingress, chessclub, WOW, forums. Or work communities: meet-ups, drinks, conventions or studies. This can be online and offline.  \\nTo do:  \\n- Map out your own communities and pick a few where you feel relevant people might be walking around. Try posting the job there in some way.\\n- Try to map out communities your perfect candidate might be a part of. So is there is a big data convention coming up, big chance there might be data people there, let’s see what we can do to get their attention. Post a job, do a talk.\\n- **Former applicants**\\n- People change and learn. Go through the list of former applicants and see if there is someone there who might be interesting now. Check the notes or ask someone who spoke to him/her earlier to make sure you invite someone interesting.\\n- Former applicants are potential fans and a good network to have. They showed interest in Blendle and a job here, so they might tip others to do so too if we play our cards right. Always be good to every applicant and you’ll see you can even ask them if they know anybody who might fit the role.\\n- **Ex employees**  \\nWe have a pretty good relationship with people who left Blendle. Think about ex employees from Blendle (or your former job) and consider approaching them to ask them if they know someone. The upside is that they know what it takes. Be careful of course, there can be a good reason why someone isn’t working at Blendle anymore.  \\nAlso consider asking if they would like the job themselves. #rehiring.  \\n- **Sourcing**  \\nSourcing is done to expand the 'natural' range. So if we can’t reach the right person via other people we know, communities or our network: we should source (we should all do it ;)). Sourcing is a skill and the real pros spend 40 hours a week on this to get results. ‘Getting someone in’ usually takes time and more than one message. That’s why Thijmen came up with the projects in Github:  \\n[https://github.com/blendle/candidates/projects](https://github.com/blendle/candidates/projects).  \\nThis is a great way to keep track of the people you are approaching for a job at Blendle. Use it, because without it, it makes no sense.  \\nOn a smaller scale, it can be interesting to ‘source 3rd connections’. So when you think about for example Linkedin: just type in the job title and one of the needed skills or expertise and see who is already in your network.  \\nSourcing tips:  \\n- [http://booleanblackbelt.com/](http://booleanblackbelt.com/)  \\n**Examples of messages**  \\n[Examples](https://www.notion.so/17846899d46d467daea10b62ccf564ff?pvs=21) (not public)  \\n**Tools**  \\nFor tech we collaborate in Github.

It won\\'t be effective nor achievable to set too many goals, or goals for an entire year at once. Make it realistic, small and measurable. Your goals should motivate you and not discourage you.

The reward is huge, when you see the people you hired adding value to the company. Imagine not hiring that person: that new idea, design, piece of code, algorithm or audio show would not have been there. Your hire could be key to the succes of Blendle: that's a lot of impact. The other side of the same coin is that it's high effort too. These 4 pointers will help you get started.  \\n- **Personnel planning**  \\nPlanning the number and type of people you need in the future is hard but also crucial. Hiring people takes time (~3 months), so looking ahead is important for making your projects succeed. Without the right (number of) people, it's hard to build a cool product.  \\nWhen making plans for **the coming and next quarter:**  \\n1. **Determine what work needs to be done, looking 3-6 months ahead, and decide if we have enough resources to do so.**  \\nOur basic premise is that we work with the team we have and we hire reactively. But ask yourself a few questions. Do you have the right number and type of people? What kind of skills, expertise, experience do you need in what amount? What can we fix internally? What can we teach the people who are at Blendle? What can we just try with advice from outside? Is your ask temporary or permanent? How is the current workload? Can we afford to ship less quickly?  \\n2. **Keep teams small.** More then 4-6 people creates more overhead (mainly communication like e-mail/slack and interactions in general) and doesn't necessarily mean that the team performs better. Jeff Bezos calls it the 2 pizza rule (you should be able to feed your team with 2 pizzas) and Ringelmann discovered 'social loafing' in 1914. People unintentionally slack when the group gets too big. Read more about this here:  \\n[The psychological theory that explains why you're better off working solo](https://qz.com/848267/the-ringelmann-effect-productivity-increases-when-youre-working-solo-rather-than-on-a-team/)  \\n[What is the optimal group size for decision-making? - Sheila Margolis](https://sheilamargolis.com/2011/01/24/what-is-the-optimal-group-size-for-decision-making/)  \\n3. **Keep budget in mind.** You should focus on getting the best team for the work you need done, but budget does play a role in this. People are our most important and most expensive resource. Hiring, therefore, is an expensive solution to a problem.\\n4. **Plan.** Discuss this step with your lead and HR.  \\nTo be able to plan you need these variables: Team, Role, Profile and role description, Hitlist, Priority, Scarceness (1-5), Years of relevant experience, Salary range, Planning.  \\nHere's an example of a template we've used in the past to plan our hiring Blendle-wide:  \\n[Google Sheets - create and edit spreadsheets online, for free.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X9C2vGjxwdD2RSXcObW6A9rgd5XaD-zoFL1OIw5y5kQ/edit#gid=981401373)  \\n- **Determine role: intake**  \\n[Opening up a new job](Hiring%201190bb744d8f46c3a449319dc1b0c31a/Opening%20up%20a%20new%20job%20fd182277377c4ad99cd03b9d76ca728c.md)  \\nUPDATE 2019: Please also check ↖︎  \\nAlright, so you came to the conclusion you need to hire someone. The next step is to pin down what you are (and aren't) exactly looking for in a candidate. This step is crucial. Rush this and you'll find yourself wobbling further down the road.  \\n*Ask for help from recruitment/HR with this. They can help you out.*  \\nThis set of questions should help you define your perfect candidate.  \\n- What team will the new person be joining? What is the goal of that team and how does that new person's job fit in there?\\n- What problems are we aiming to solve by hiring this person? What would it look like when the problem is solved?\\n- What impact do we expect this person to make in his/her - let's say - first 6 months?\\n- What does good performance and success look like for this person? What do you expect from him/her?\\n- What challenges or downsides does this role have?\\n- What would you call the role? Is it an existing role (if yes: think if you can use someone as a blueprint, if no: make sure to check if our job title matches with other companies).\\n- How much experience do you think this person needs? What kind and type of experience? In what kind and type of environments? Do you expect this person to be plug and play or is there room for learning and growing?\\n- What could someone's career path look like at Blendle? What do we have to offer there?\\n- Do you expect this person to lead a team or guild in a way?\\n- What would a average week look like for this person?\\n- What are examples of projects that were there the last quarter which could have been done by the new hire? What projects or topics are coming up?\\n- What kind of skills, knowledge, expertise or experience does this person need? Make a distinction between must-haves and nice-to-haves. Be specific.\\n- What kind of skills are lacking in the current team which this new person should bring?\\n- Selling points: why would someone quit his job for this role? Think about the team, the role and Blendle.  \\nShare this with the hiring team, so everybody is on the same page on what we are looking for.  \\n**When pinning down the profile, keep [the Matrix™](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=1890661785) and Work, Drive and Fit in mind. That's also what your hiring team is going to rate the candidates on, so it's good to know what they have to be rating.**  \\nIf it's a new role, it can be hard to pin these questions down. You can use this set of questions to ask experts in the field to help you pin down the profile as described in the section '[Getting people in'](https://www.notion.so/beae540c6eb54f87b43bb2123d50f23e?pvs=21) section 3: Sourcing:  \\n> Source to pin down your profile. New roles can be hard to pin down in a few bullet points. Since we can only hire (or turn down) someone if we know exactly what we are looking for, sourcing can be a good addition. Make a list of 20 people who match your profile so far on paper, ask your top 5 if they would like to have a cup of coffee with you. Use those conversations to finish your profile.\\n>\\n- **Finish job description & get started**  \\nGo to [admin.homerun.co](http://admin.homerun.co) and log in with your google account from Blendle.  \\n1. Ask HR to duplicate a template for you and make you hiring manager or reuse an existing job description and go from there.\\n2.

Marten and Alexander expected a few friends and partners to show up in an old warehouse in Amsterdam for their 'launch' party. 30 minutes before the start, the room filled with cameras and reporters. More then enough people were interested to see and hear what they came up with. Even PowNews sent a reporter:  \\n[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)  \\nA little rewind: in 2011, Marten found himself in a bookstore, a bit frustrated, looking at a magazine (as reenacted beautifully in this picture below). He was frustrated that he had to buy the whole magazine, whereas he only wanted to read one article from it. The first idea for Blendle was born and was called MyMagazine. He started talking to a lot of people in the media world, including Alexander. Alexander wasn't convinced yet.  \\n![History%20693ddd24378a4f89b912fba429e9c846/marten.jpg](History%20693ddd24378a4f89b912fba429e9c846/marten.jpg)  \\nIn **mid-2012**, Marten asked Jort to make the first sketches and wireframes.  \\n**June 2012**, these are the first sketches of Blendle:  \\n![History%20693ddd24378a4f89b912fba429e9c846/Schetsen-van-juni-2012-960x698.png](History%20693ddd24378a4f89b912fba429e9c846/Schetsen-van-juni-2012-960x698.png)  \\n![History%20693ddd24378a4f89b912fba429e9c846/screenshot-trending-960x513.png](History%20693ddd24378a4f89b912fba429e9c846/screenshot-trending-960x513.png)  \\nAlexander and Marten stay in touch and, after seeing the first sketches, Alexander sees the potential and decides to join. Together they have an 'office' in the staircase of the science centre Nemo in Amsterdam. With the prototypes and Alexander on board, the conversations with the publishers actually start to get interesting. Alexander and Marten take all the feedback and criticism from the publishers back to their 'office' and keep improving the product.  \\nIn **September 2013,** Blendle received ****100,000 euros from a fund for innovation in journalism.  \\n**5 September 2013:** First announcement of Blendle in the Dutch TV show DWDD:  \\n[https://www.notion.so](https://www.notion.so)  \\n**28 April 2014:** Launch in NL  \\nIn the meantime, Blendle got an office upgrade and moved to the Jaarbeurs in the beautiful Utrecht.

You can, but don't have to.

But: **it's their responsibility.**\\n- Make sure people **communicate** their time off well with the team and you. You have a say in this and you have to agree on someones time off (which will be fine in 99% of cases).\\n- Make sure your people put it in the **@all and their own agenda.**\\n- When life happens (funeral, moving, child, dentist), you have the liberty to **agree on what is needed** for this person in this specific situation. When in doubt, ask HR.\\n- When people work hard, **poke them** to take time off so they recharge.\\n- For longer leaves of absence (~4 weeks) ping HR for advice.  \\n---  \\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

Good feedback is the key to a good collaboration, happy people and even a successful company. As a lead, you are responsible for leading the feedback for your people. This section will help you do so. Look at this list as a toolkit for you and your colleagues.  \\n- **The Feedback Cycle**  \\nThe general information about the feedback cycle for everyone can be found here:  \\n[Feedback cycle](Feedback%20cycle%20852da91b13f3470eb3522a232d929567.md)  \\n- **Quick links to tooling and formats**\\n- For everything related to goals and feedback, go to: [https://goals.blendle.io/](https://goals.blendle.io/reviews)\\n- For **your own review page** go to: [https://goals.blendle.io/reviews](https://goals.blendle.io/reviews)\\n- For an overview of **the feedback you got** go to: [https://goals.blendle.io/reviews/overview](https://goals.blendle.io/reviews/overview)\\n- For an **overview of your teammembers** go to: [https://goals.blendle.io/reviews/planning](https://goals.blendle.io/reviews/planning) and [https://goals.blendle.io/teams/me](https://goals.blendle.io/teams/me).\\n- **The Matrix™** can be found [**here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=1108390117).**  \\n**Why?**  \\nThe Feedback cycle is all about taking a step back and look at the greater picture. Summarizing all the input from the last few months, highlighting areas that need attention and looking forward and creating perspective.  \\n**How?**  \\nThe process for team leads looks like this, click on the toggle for tips and more information per step. We do this cycle 2 times a year (January and around summer).  \\n**Week 1 and 2: Preparation is key**  \\n- 1. Kick off meeting with all team leads by Team HR.  \\nTeam HR will schedule a meeting with all leads in the first week to go over new stuff, refresh our feedback memories, answer questions and discuss worry points.  \\n- 2. Self review, send out peer reviews and check if all your team members did the same.  \\nTeam HR blocks time in everyone's agenda.  \\n- **Lead by example** and make sure you did your own review on time and try to actively stimulate your team members and peers to do the same.\\n- **Check in with your team members** to see if they have questions. Keep in mind that all formats are just formats and a means to an end. Don't get hung up over semantics or form, feel free to freewheel if you think it's serves the overall goal.  \\n- 3. Write peer reviews and check if team members did the same.\\n1. **Manage your time:** you will get invites and you have to make reviews for your team. Keep that in mind and feel free to decline requests if you have too much on your plate. You can also just quickly write something in 5 bullets if you get too many requests.\\n2. **Write reviews for your team members:** they can (probably will) invite you, but you can also proactively write a review for them. Go to the invite section below, and type in the 'Find colleague' bar and click 'Start review'. The form speaks for itself.  \\n![Leading%20Feedback%20b70052e8e49e4c52a6502ab41dff6576/Schermafbeelding2018-06-19om17.04.43.png](Leading%20Feedback%20b70052e8e49e4c52a6502ab41dff6576/Schermafbeelding2018-06-19om17.04.43.png)  \\nHow to write a good review: this might sound simple, but it isn't. Here are a few pointers.  \\n- **Blank page:** Before going to the 'form', try writing down your thoughts and feelings on a piece of blank piece of paper. This way you don't steer (or limit) your thoughts yet. After that, just go through the form.\\n- Ask questions: when you arranged your thoughts on a blank piece of paper, ask yourself some 'control' questions before you start filling in the form.\\n- Would you hire this person again?\\n- Does someone's contribution match with someone's seniority level and pay rate? How come? What expectation isn't this person meeting?\\n- Do you see this person working here in a year? How would that look?\\n- Take a look at **former reviews, goals, notes and 1on1's.**\\n- **No new information:** your review shouldn't contain surprises. You've been having 1on1's and discussing feedback and praise in those.\\n- **Use ratings and be fierce:** don't be scared to give a 1, as long as you explain it. Also, keep someone's level in mind. You can expect more for people with experience and it's a compliment if you are fierce in your review.\\n- **Use the Matrix™:** more on this later, but make sure to look at the discipline of your team member and keep the different traits of work, drive and fit in mind. Try using the same terms, so it's easier to know what your point is.\\n- **Keep it short and give examples:** try to focus your feedback. What points would you really like to get across? Offering too much feedback can make it hard to know what's most important. Also, use examples and try to highlight themes (you tend to finish things quick and dirty, in situation XYZ) instead of a single skill (you should get better at writing).\\n- **Red flag?:** When you've written your review, be aware of a red flag. How 'heavy' do you expect the conversation to be? Prepare for heavy conversations by asking for advice from your own lead or HR.\\n- 4. Plan and prepare your own review with your lead.  \\nSchedule a meeting with your lead first (also before the other reviews).  \\nBlock time to prepare.  \\n- 5. Plan and start preparing reviews with your team members.  \\nWe recommend blocking a day or two half days and doing your reviews back to back. Make sure you plan enough time between so you have time to prepare.  \\nIf you are in a situation where you have a 2nd seat, you are in charge of the planning, just check with the 2nd seat for his/her availability.  \\n**Week 3 and 4: It's all about execution**  \\n- 1. Have your own feedback session.  \\nFor this I forward you to the general page about feedback:  \\n- 2. Finish preparing feedback sessions and remind team members to prepare.  \\nPrep is key. Without a proper preparation, there is no point in having the feedback session. Here's how you can prep well:  \\n1. Read all the reviews\\n2. Highlight differences between them and highlight things that draw your attention (things you would like to discuss).\\n3. Take another good look at the self review of your team member.\\n4. Take your own review as a starting point for the talk and try to come up with 2 or 3 overall themes you notice across the review.\\n5. Check if there are red flags you really need to bring up.\\n6. Check the pointers we give you in the next section.  \\n**Control questions:**  \\nAre there big differences between the self-review of the team member themselves and what other people (including you) think?  \\nDid your team member ask peers you think can give the most valuable feedback? Anyone missing? If you already notice that there isn't enough valuable input, consider flagging it with the team member.  \\nDo you see anything standing out in the reviews? Think about following up on this with the specific peers.  \\n- 3. Have the feedback sessions with your team members.  \\n1st and 2nd seat: for a lot of people it makes sense for more people then just the lead to join. Especially in the tech and product teams. It can have a lot of added value for people who switch teams a lot to have more people join in  \\n1. **Intro**: Hi X, welcome. We have 45 minutes to digest all the feedback you got in your reviews. The goal is to really look for overall themes and in the end work towards concrete goals. This conversation is a two-way street and you are in the lead. I prepared some talking points that I thought were interesting, but I’d like you to take the lead. The easiest way to structure this talk is to just simply go over the questions and the input you got there.  \\nNote: you have to take notes yourself. Pro tip: start a recording with your phone.  \\n2. **Kick off question** (goal is to get a sense of how someone is feeling): But before we dig in, I’d like to know what your overall feeling/thoughts were when going through all the feedback?\\n3. **Space to talk**: take time for this first question, it’s important. If someone is directly going to the concrete feedback, get back to the structure of the form and ask them to start with the feedback he/she got on the first question.\\n4. **Go through the questions in the review form**. Just listen and ask questions, make sure you are on the same page about the feedback that was given. If someone is discarding a very important or heavy point: make sure to mention that. Try to get your talking points across when the team member is bringing them up in answer to a certain question.  \\n‘Funny, I wrote that down too, how do you think we can improve that point?’. ‘Good to see your peers also see your hard work and dedication. I also wrote that down and project X where you did ABC is a really good example of it, do you recognize that?’  \\n5. **Look for overall themes (bigger points) in the feedback**. Try not to dig too deep into the details of concrete projects, feedback or tasks. Use the concrete stuff as an example to make a bigger point. Try to look for bigger points or themes across the concrete feedback. The so-called 'red thread'. Embed this in your questioning.  \\nAlso, try to dig a bit deeper by asking questions and not taking an easy answer (without going all Freud on someone). Here are a few tips:  \\n- Ask **short follow-up questions.** Examples:  \\nWhy is that? How do you feel about that? When did that happen before? How does that work? What did you do? What could you have done? Can you give an example? Can you explain? What stands out for you? Were there things you disagreed with? Which one? How come?  \\n- Ask neutral questions, without suggestion. So don't include the answer you think or hope you are going to get. Example: 'Did that make you feel stressed?' is less effective than 'How did you feel?'. Unless you specifically want to know someone's stress level, in which case you can use the next tip: ratings.\\n- **Use ratings** to get a better understanding. Example: on a scale of 1 to 10, how happy are you with your current role? Or how would you rate your current stress level?\\n- **Use silence.** It's time to think. Try keeping your mouth shut when silence occurs.\\n- **Listen.** Again: keep that mouth shut and practice the art of listening. Don't bother about the next question or that one thing you want to say. You are well prepared, you'll get your points across. Start with really listening to what someone was to say. You can use paraphrasing for this, but it tends to get annoying hearing 'So if I understand you correctly you mean ...' for the third time.\\n- Be curious and eager to understand. Just be human and use your sincere interest in that other person to really understand what someone is saying or maybe not saying.\\n6. **Ask for feedback**, how someone is feeling (stress level, work-life balance) and check overall happiness. Try asking about Blendle-wide stuff. For example how they feel about the current direction of the company and how they think you or the other leads are doing.\\n7. Go meta: you will know when you feel like you scratched the surface. Try one of these meta questions to turn the tide, by focussing on highs or lows:\\n- What are you most proud of over the past 6 months? Why?\\n- Do you ever get out of bed reluctant to go to work? When?\\n- If you had all the money in the world, what would you do from day to day?\\n- If you had your own company, what would it do/make/produce?\\n- What would you change of you were me or Alexander  \\n8. Try to **agree on the outline of the goals** and aks your team member to come up with a concrete list and add a deadline. This is also to check if the points you think are important came across. Did someone understand?  \\n**Week 4: Finish strong**  \\n- Follow-up on session and help with goals.  \\n- **The Matrix™**  \\nGeneral info about The Matrix**™** can be found here:  \\n[The Matrix™ (job profiles)](The%20Matrix%E2%84%A2%20(job%20profiles)%2034a96a37d49d41efa24d1184e77c1d8f.md)  \\nFor you as a lead, there are a few extra pointers on how to use The Matrix**™.**  \\n1. **It's a means to an end,** use it that way. It's not the holy grail, it's a living document with the purpose to give perspective and lower the bar for good feedback and meaningful conversations.\\n2. **Roles can cover multiple disciplines.** We encourage people to constantly push themselves and explore new skills or gain new knowledge. This results in people having roles which cover multiple disciplines. Keep that in mind when using the matrix for an individual. You can also use other disciplines as an inspiration.\\n3. The **levels aren't seniority levels**, so keep that in mind. There is a correlation of course. The more level 3 traits someone masters, the more senior someone probably will be.\\n4. Use it as **a yardstick.** Think about where you think someone should be on certain traits based on their level of experience and age and use it as an individual yardstick. Make sure you both agree on that level of expectation for that person together and agree on what the biggest improvement points are and how to improve them.\\n5. **Personalise.** In the end, we would love the have a tailor-made matrix for everyone, but this will do for now. Feel free to redefine certain traits or even add levels together.\\n- **Make notes**  \\n**Why?**  \\nWell, because you forget. Plus making notes forces you to constantly think about the feedback. We would recommend making it a habit at the end of the week (weekly review ftw!): how did X do?  \\nIf you have a good system, it will also allow you to look back. ‘Didn’t we discuss this already a year ago? It’s still an issue’. It also shows that you don’t forget and take this seriously.  \\n**How?**  \\nDocs, Evernote, Todoist, Wunderlist, Word, Things or even a notebook (I would not recommend a notebook). Whatever works. Just make small notes: You did well on project X and meeting Y, because ABC. I really liked when you did X, because it had an effect on ABC. It helps you during the reviews every 6 months.  \\n- **Continuous Feedback**  \\n**Why?**  \\nDon’t save up feedback, it’s less powerful. Just speak your mind. The more often you do this, the easier it gets. This goes both ways: good and bad. I never heard someone say he or she got too much feedback.  \\n**How?**  \\nFace to face is best (e-mail/slack/chat is ok for practical stuff).  \\nPraise in public, feedback 1on1.  \\nThink about:  \\n- quality of work: you did well on X. Because ABC.\\n- way of working: you were slow and distracted, how can I help?\\n- behaviour: try not to interrupt people during the meeting.  \\nThere are a lot of tips out there on how to give feedback.  \\nI like the HIP-approach:  \\n- **H**umble\\n- **H**elpful\\n- **I**mmediate\\n- **I**n person\\n- **P**rivate criticism/ **P**ublic Praise\\n- Not about **P**ersonality  \\nSource:  \\n[A HIP Approach to Feedback | Achieve Radical Candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/blog/a-hip-approach-to-feedback/)  \\n- **Have scheduled (bi-)weekly 1on1's**  \\n**Why?**  \\nIt’s important and it's not going to happen if you don’t schedule it. If all is fine it might feel too much. It isn’t. Goal is to ‘stay in touch’ and simply have a relationship with someone. The relationship is the basis for being able to give good feedback and it makes it easier to receive too.  \\n**How?**  \\nIt works best if you have a standard agenda for this meeting. I would not recommend winging it every time.  \\n[re:Work - Guide: Coach managers to coach](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/managers-coach-managers-to-coach/steps/hold-effective-1-1-meetings/)  \\nHere’s an outline we like.  \\n- Personal: How are you feeling today? Why is that? What’s going on in your life at the moment? What’s on your mind?\\n- Work: What are you working on? What do you like/dislike? Any roadblocks/issues?\\n- Feedback and coaching: Share the feedback you wrote down. Do you have any feedback for me?\\n- Goals: How are you progressing on your personal goals? Need help?  \\n*Review action points last week and make new ones*  \\nI would recommend asking your team member to come up with an agenda, to also make them feel they are in control and in the lead.  \\nLast but not least: take 15-30 minutes to prepare. Both parties shouldn’t accept the meeting going forward without preparing.  \\nWe can highly recommend listening to this three part course from Manager Tools on 1:1’s. It's sometimes a bit cheesy (including the theme music) but the contents are very much worth it.  \\n[One-on-Ones - Part 1 (Hall Of Fame Guidance) | Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1)  \\n[Map of the Universe™ | Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-2](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-2))  \\n[One-on-Ones - Part 3 (Hall Of Fame Guidance) | Manager Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-3)  \\nA great book on this topic is ‘High Output Management’ from Andy Grove. Available here, let us know if you'd like to read this and we can order it for you.  \\n[bol.com | High Output Management, Andrew Grove | 9780679762881 | Boeken](https://www.bol.com/nl/f/high-output-management/9200000050107971/)  \\n- **Give input and flag**  \\nYou are the gatekeeper for the performance and development of your team members. If people excel, we should reward them. If someone is underperforming we should look for solutions. We want you to flag both situations with the MT and the HR team. First step is to tell the team member yourself, but keep 'the rest' in the loop too.  \\nDon't wait for a review cycle or contract which expires to give this a thought.  \\n- Optional: **Skip level session and upward feedback**  \\n**Skip level session:**  \\nAlso called an upward feedback session. A session where your team members sit down with your lead to talk about you. Your lead makes notes and shares them with you afterwords.  \\n“If you’re a manager of managers, you need to make sure that everyone on your team feels they can criticize their boss,” Scott says. But she’s quick to note that this does not mean encouraging your team to be boss killers. Instead, she recommends putting this advice into practice with a simple meeting — commonly called a 'skip-level meeting,' though that sounds hierarchical, so she prefers to call them 'manager guidance sessions.'  \\nThe process is straightforward: First, let your managers know that you’ll be scheduling a meeting with their direct reports. Get them comfortable with the idea, and make it clear that this meeting is intended to be helpful to them. Then explain the process to the reports, again making it clear that the goal of the meeting is to help their boss be a better manager — and that the meeting is not for attribution.  \\n“In other words, I would tell the manager what everybody said but not who said it. Not because I wanted to foster secrecy, but because I wanted to help get the information out there,” says Scott. “If there were too many things the team didn’t feel comfortable saying directly to their boss, and if it wasn’t getting better over time, that became the top thing I worked with the manager to change.”  \\n[Radical Candor - The Surprising Secret to Being a Good Boss](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/)  \\nJust let us know if you would like one and we will organize it for you :).  \\n**Upward feedback**  \\nSomething you can do yourself is asking for upward feedback using a typeform/googleform. Send these questions to your team and see where you're at:  \\n- My teamlead regularly gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance.\\n- My teamlead does not micromanage (i.e., get involved in details that should be handled at other levels).\\n- My teamlead regularly shares relevant info and/or insights from the MT.\\n- My teamlead is easy to approach with problems/concerns/feedback.\\n- My teamlead communicates clear goals for our team.\\n- My teamlead keeps the team focus on our priority results/deliverables/OKR’s.  \\nSome good reads:  \\n[How Google Management Measures its Effectiveness](https://getlighthouse.com/blog/google-management/)  \\n[11 ways to get feedback from your most introverted employee](https://m.signalvnoise.com/11-ways-to-get-feedback-from-your-most-introverted-employee-7a6317121b47)  \\n[Our 6 Must Reads for Managers to Give Feedback That Helps People Grow](http://firstround.com/review/our-6-must-reads-for-managers-to-give-feedback-that-helps-people-grow/)  \\nWith a great example attached: [https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/SS7xTRITymhxGQQ37eaY](https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/SS7xTRITymhxGQQ37eaY)  \\n[Radical Candor - The Surprising Secret to Being a Good Boss](http://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/)  \\n---  \\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

       " Document(page_content=\"**Workplace:**  \\nWe have a semi-flex workspace. Some people like to sit at the same desk 80% of the time and switch after a few months when joining another team or because they want a different view. Most teams are clustered together, simply because it's handy when working together. So do whatever helps you focus, collaborate or brainstorm.  \\n---  \\n**The headphone rule:**  \\nWe don't like rules tbh, but focus is important to finish tasks. You are the boss of your agenda and you are in charge of when you can be disturbed and when you can't. Headphones on = do not disturb. Simple, right? Try it out!  \\n---  \\n**Lunch**  \\n~12 o' clock, there is lunch in the canteen, free of cost. Joëlle is in charge of lunch —\\xa0ask her if you need anything (allergies for example).  \\nWhat you can expect from lunch:  \\n- Healthy: We try to offer products that are not bad for you!\\n- Enough for everyone: The goal is to have enough food for everyone. But sometimes we just run out of stock, bad luck... No worries, we will get some more next time.\\n- Variety: Variation is good. But it's also good to keep some things special. Like luxury products or snacks, we order these occasionally. This should keep it special and within our budget.\\n- If you have any food related suggestions, be free to send them to officemanagement@blendle.com. But remember this, we can not cater to all individual needs. But we always take suggestions into consideration.  \\n---  \\n**Dinner - Delivery by Smulderskookt.nl**  \\nBlendle offers dinner to whoever is staying later than normal office hours. It doesn't matter what team you are in, if you are in the office during evening hours you can order food.  \\nThe dinner is catered by Smulderskookt.nl. and is delivered Monday - Thursday between 18.00 and 19.00 pm.

Take your cups to the dishwasher. Throw away your stuff. Don't forget to do a chore on your own initiative every now and then. Do the dishwasher (turn it on, clean it out), throw away trash or clean the coffee machine.

No matter if you are already a parent or are going to be one, you might have some questions about what Blendle has in place for Blendle moms and dads. This page should contain all the information you seek.  \\n- **Maternity leave**  \\nWhen you're pregnant, we recommend you inform your lead and HR no later than 3 months before your due date. This way we have enough time for the necessary paperwork with UWV. We also need a pregnancy statement from your doctor with the due date.  \\n**Some practical info:**  \\n1. Absence during pregnancy:  \\nIf you happen to get ill because of your pregnancy or if you have to be absent because of doctor appointments, please inform your lead. Our general guidelines on [Holidays](https://www.notion.so/Holidays-x-7eb8ac8f904b4e50a7c23133a7992f2c?pvs=21) and [Sickness](https://www.notion.so/Sickness-absence-7de9e568d0c2452682cc14e525c2ea69?pvs=21) absence also apply in this case.  \\n2. Salary:  \\nNothing changes here. Blendle pays your full salary.  \\n3. Duration of maternity leave:  \\nBy law you are entitled to 16 weeks of paid maternity leave. And you decide when your leave starts. The leave can start anywhere between 6-4 weeks before your due date. If you are pregnant with twins or more... you can leave between 10-8 weeks before your due date. Please let us know if you encounter unexpected complications during this time. We understand it's not always easy and will do our best to accommodate your situation.  \\nThere are a couple more exceptions that can affect your maternity leave. You can either contact HR for more info or [visit the government’s info page.](https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/zwangerschapsverlof-en-bevallingsverlof/vraag-en-antwoord/hoe-lang-duurt-zwangerschapsverlof-en-bevallingsverlof)  \\n**To-do during pregnancy:**  \\n1. At least 3 months before your due date:\\n- Tell your lead and HR that you are pregnant\\n- Show your pregnancy statement to HR\\n2. At least 3 weeks before your leave:\\n- Together with your lead, set a date for your leave and inform HR\\n- Discuss possible work-related adjustments with your lead (like parental leave, breastfeeding)\\n3. Within 4 weeks after birth:\\n- Inform HR of the birth date\\n- Let your lead and HR know if you need anything when you are back at work  \\n- **Birth leave**  \\nAs a partner (if you are not the one giving birth) you are also entitled to leave after the birth of your child. The official term for this is birth leave. By law you can take 1 week off to enjoy your new offspring and help your partner. We think that is way too short, so we are adding 3 extra weeks on top of that. So you have the option to take 4 weeks off, but if you don't want to, you do not have to :). During these **4 weeks** you get your full salary paid. Just make sure you and your lead have made arrangements about the continuity of the ongoing projects/work within your team during your absence.Again, please let us know if you and your partner encounter unexpected complications. We’ll do our best to help where we can.  \\n- **Parental leave**  \\nAs a parent (both parents) you are also entitled to parental leave for every child. In total, you can have **26 x your weekly work hours** off per child. If you work 40 hours a week, it would be 1040 hours total parental leave for each child.  So this right applies to each child separately and you can make use of it until a child is 8 years old. You can choose to take time off either for a longer period at once, or spread it. For example 1 day per week off.  \\n**Important note→** You won't be getting salary and other allowances during the parental leave. And technically, you are not saving up for holiday hours and you are not saving up for holiday allowance.  \\nPlease let your lead and HR know if you are planning to take parental leave. HR can help you with all your questions. # Party and study budget  \\nThere is money and time you can spend on celebrating stuff and for learning and development. We want you, as a Team Lead, to feel free to spend this money and time within these boundaries so you don't need permission every time you spend it on these two topics. We want to create clarity so you have the liberty\\xa0to spend money on this. We don't want to limit your thinking by coming up with a budget, so feel free to ask HR if you'd like to bend the budgets for a good reason.  \\nYou are in the lead for these two topics for your team.\", metadata={'Header 1': 'Work at Blendle'}),\n",

Does it match the role and responsibilities?  \\nA good control question is if you would spend the money on this if it was your own.

This could also be a 5+ point scale, but we noticed more options doesn\\'t make it easier.  \\n**1**: Poor  \\n**2**: Acceptable  \\n**3**: Good  \\nNotice how a **2** is a positive and not a neutral score, but three 2\\'s is probably not enough. More on that later on.  \\n- **Work, Drive and Fit.**  \\nDuring the process we score people on:  \\n*Note: this doesn\\'t cover everything, but it\\'s a good start. We tried to keep it simple.*  \\n**Work:** how good is our candidate at his/her job?  \\n**Drive:** how driven and intrinsically motivated is our candidate?  \\n**Fit:** how well does our candidate match with Blendle as a company and the team?  \\n- Want to know what work, drive and fit really entails: go the the **[Matrix™](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit#gid=1890661785)** and get inspired.\\n- At the beginning of the hiring process, the hiring manager and hiring team draw up a profile, also based on work, drive and fit and the matrix. That profile is your blueprint and that\\'s also your yardstick for your ratings. Rating the coding skills of a lead iOS developer is different from rating someone who still has a lot to learn, so what we are looking for determines how we rate. Hope that makes sense :).\\n- **How do you rate?**\\n- **Fierce but fair:** be critical. It\\'s important that the whole hiring team does this so the process isn\\'t skewed.\\n- **With arguments:** the rating has to have a foundation. This is really important when it comes to a decision. If you don\\'t have any, don\\'t give a rating. Just keep in mind that this means you missed a spot in your interview or part of the process. You didn\\'t get the information you needed to give a rating, but that is why you are involved in the process.\\n- **Alone:** you rate by yourself. Try not to influence each other too much by already talking to each other before rating. Sounds a bit \\'high-school-ish\\' but even a \\'this is really good\\' already primes your mind in a way. People like to agree ;).\\n- **Immediate:** after every step in the process, rate immediately. Write your thoughts and rating down somewhere.\\n- **Through the process:** How your thoughts evolve through the process is also really valuable information. For example: based on the Github profile, you think someone is not really good at - let\\'s say - testing, so you give a 1 on Work because we decided that this is important for us. You can embed this in the assignment and pair day and actively look for someone\\'s testing skills to check the 1 you gave at first.\\n- **The rating process.**  \\nSo you rate continuously throughout the process.  \\nAt every crossroad during the process, you use your ratings to make a decision.  \\nSo take another look at the whole [hiring process](https://www.notion.so/Hiring-process-c19f8f3d05034b42b2bb42e330b8a934?pvs=21).  \\n![Rating%20systems%208af9e7d7fb1a4e21af1326a2a48bfda9/Schermafbeelding2018-07-11om08.38.02.png](Rating%20systems%208af9e7d7fb1a4e21af1326a2a48bfda9/Schermafbeelding2018-07-11om08.38.02.png)  \\nAfter every step you have a decision to make: turn down or take next step. Untill step 4, the decision making can go via comments on GH, in e-mail or Homerun. It\\'s good to already use the ratings to ground your decisions and test your assumptions.  \\nAfter the 2nd interview (with an optional next step) the hiring team has to make a yes/no decision. We want you to do this right after the last step (or the day after), in real life.  \\nThis meeting goes like this:  \\n- **Part 1: ratings**  \\nHiring manager is in the lead of this meeting and starts with three questions:  \\n\"What is your overall rating on Work? 3, 2, 1...\"  \\n*Everybody shows at the same time his/her rating by raising 1, 2 or 3 fingers.*  \\n\"What is your overall rating on Drive? 3, 2, 1...\"  \\n*Everybody shows at the same time his/her rating by raising 1, 2 or 3 fingers.*  \\n\"What is your overall rating on Fit? 3, 2, 1...\"  \\n*Everybody shows at the same time his/her rating by raising 1, 2 or 3 fingers.*  \\n- **Part 2: elaborate**  \\n\"What where your ratings and why?\"  \\nMake a round, ask each other questions and challenge bias and assumptions. It\\'s okay to not know, just be honest.  \\n- **Part 3: hiring decision**  \\n\"Thumbs up or thumbs down: 3, 2, 1...\"  \\n*Everybody puts his/her thumb up or down at the same time.*  \\nThe goal is to make a unanimous decision. If you disagree, try convincing each other. If you still disagree, consider taking an extra step or turning the candidate down.  \\nMore on this in the next section: when is it a yes, when is it a no?  \\n- **So when is it yes/no?**  \\nThis is hard, because hiring people is always a risk. You don\\'t know everything.  \\n- **A few pointers**\\n- Don\\'t underestimate the power of a good (or bad) Fit. Don\\'t hire people you wouldn\\'t **enjoy** working with.\\n- **Nobody is seeing the whole picture**, so fight arguments that are opinions being brought as facts.\\n- Extravert people who work longer at Blendle tend to dominate the discussion. Seniority counts, sure. But it\\'s important to **weigh up everyone\\'s opinion**. Ask each other questions if you feel like not everybody is speaking up.\\n- The hiring manager has the last say and will lead the discussion.\\n- If you continue to disagree, try asking a **third party** to the table (HR/Rick/Alex) to moderate the discussion.\\n- If you are 80% sure, that\\'s a good score. It\\'s impossible to know everything based on a resume, an assignment and an interview.\\n- Always take a look at the original profile from when you started your hunt for a new colleague. Does this person check all the boxes? Where did we compromise? Are we okay with that?\\n- **Look at your rating**  \\nAs said, this is no exact science  \\nExamples:  \\n(W)ork (D)rive (F)it  \\n**W: 2 D:1 F:2:** 1 on anything is always a red flag and probably no hire.  \\n**W: 2 D:2 F:2** Without a 3 on anything, it can be a hire, but it can\\'t be a new key person of position. Consider taking an extra step. If a lot of other people in the hiring team do have 3\\'s, it can be an immediate hire.  \\n**W: 2 D:1 F:3:** probably no hire: a 3 on fit does never compensate for a 1 on Drive (or Work)  \\n**W: 3 D:2 F:2** is probably a hire.  \\n**W: 2 D:3 F:3** is a hire. If we\\'re looking for a rockstar, this might not by your ideal rating though.  \\n- **Look at your process and notes**  \\nHow did I get here? You made notes and gave ratings throughout the proces. Go over these notes once again to validate your current opinion. What convinced you on certain topics. What did you ask or see during the pair session?  \\n- **Look at the ratings and arguments of others**  \\nThis is the point where you also calibrate your rating and arguments. You might have been too fierce or too soft on the candidate and you heard good arguments to adjust your opinion. Feel free to do so, that\\'s the point :).  \\n- **Look at the original profile**  \\nSo what were you originally looking for? A very important question before you make your final decision.  \\n---  \\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

This is how we did the very first round of company wide salary raises at Blendle:  \\n[How to do company wide salary raises at a startup (for the first time).](https://medium.com/@rologrootenboer/how-to-do-company-wide-salary-raises-at-a-startup-for-the-first-time-c8a17f6302e6)  \\nThe process today is pretty similar, with one big difference: you are at the center of it.  \\nNo stress, you are at the center but not alone, we got your back. Starting with answering the most important questions one by one and giving you the context you need.  \\n- **Who is in the lead?**  \\nYou as a lead are in the center of all this because you get the questions and you have the best \\'view\\' and therefore the ability to decide.  \\nRick and Alex (with help from HR) eventually decide. They guard the overall salary house and make sure our costs (and growth of that costs) are budgeted and taken into account when thinking about runway. They will also come up with a structure and budget and range for the raises in January.  \\n- **How do we determine someone\\'s salary in the first place?**  \\nWe weigh up several variables:  \\n- **Benchmark:** internal and external.  \\nThe most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you\\'ll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person to in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocare people in tech. We don\\'t want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make.  \\n- **Classic figures:** experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.  \\nThis is a bit old school in a way, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is a starter with no experience or someone with 8 years of experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag.  \\n- **Scarcity & market value.**  \\nIt\\'s fair to say that it\\'s harder to fill some positions compared to some other roles. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.  \\n- **Role and responsibilities.**  \\nCertain roles and people make more impact than others. This is reflected in pay.  \\n- **Actual impact and contribution**  \\nSince we don\\'t really like job titles, it\\'s good to look at someone\\'s actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making? Can we try to put that in numbers or concrete projects?  \\n- **Someone\\'s starting point**  \\nIf we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.  \\n*Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*  \\n- **When do we talk about money?**\\n- 1. **Yearly company wide salary raises in January**  \\nEvery year (in January) we take a good look at all the salaries at Blendle. Right after the feedback cycle (which we use as input) we have salary talks with everyone. We chose to do this once a year so we don\\'t have a constant conversation about money through the year. We don\\'t think a contract renewal (which is basically just paperwork) should be the moment to talk about money. Mainly because you don\\'t want people to say: give me X or I walk. People can quit any time they want and bring up salary any moment they want, just not as a tactic combined with renewing a contract.  \\n- 2. **Colleague brings it up her/himself**  \\nWe don\\'t want people to be unhappy about something stupid like money, so we want people to tell us if they are unhappy with their pay. We take everybody seriously if they feel like their pay is too low (or too high). We do ask people to come with arguments so we can have an actual talk. More than just: I want more money. You as a lead are the one they will come to with these questions. You are in the lead of coming up with a good answer and making sure someone is happy with that answer (even if it\\'s a no).  \\n- 3. **We bring it up, adhoc.**  \\nWith \\'we\\', we mean anyone from Blendle who isn\\'t the person in question. Could be you, a senior colleague, Jean, Rick, Alex or HR.  \\n- **Should we raise, yes or no?**  \\nThis question mainly applies to the last two situations, because we review everyone in January.  \\n**Good reasons to raise:**  \\n- Drastic change in role and responsibilities. You can use the matrix to pin this down together.\\n- Very steep learning curve which makes current pay unfair for someone\\'s impact and capabilities. It\\'s important to be able to quantify that curve.\\n- New information internally or externally.\\n- New information by benchmarking studies or during hiring.  \\n*Note: notice how important the feedback cycle, continuous feedback, 1on1\\'s, feedback from peers and personal goals are in all this 🙂?*  \\n**Not so good reasons to give a raise**  \\n- Colleague got another offer and uses this to get a raise.\\n- \\'I earn X for this company, that\\'s a lot of money, I want a piece of the pie\\'.\\n- Colleague just wants an incentive to stay. Money is never the answer, because it will fade - very - fast.\\n- **How much should we raise?**  \\nAgain in January, Rick & Alex will work together with HR to come up with a solid structure and range which will guide you through the process. This mainly applies to ad hoc raises.  \\nIf you decide that it is a good idea to raise (disregarding who took the initiative) the reasoning behind it is a good starting point.  \\nIf you take the four reasons we mentioned above:  \\n- **Drastic change in role and responsibilites or very steep learning curve:** consider raising someone in the range of 0-5% or see if the \\'new role\\' is comparable with someone in the company and let go of the range if needed.\\n- **New information.**  \\nExternally: N=1, so make sure to gather enough intel. Benchmark studies always end up giving a pretty wide range (up to €1000), so it\\'s hard to apply this to an individual situation.  \\nInternally it\\'s most important that people are paid fairly compared to each other.  \\n- **Control questions**  \\nNow before you finally decide  \\n- If we had to hire someone today for X\\'s job, what would we pay them?\\n- What would it cost Blendle as a business to find a new person (hard to replace, scarcity, time to hire, impact on day to day business & product)?\\n- Giving a raise to an individual changes the salary house, so keep that in mind when you decide on a raise. Does this apply to more people?  \\n---  \\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

Everything that is not concrete or directly work-related, but is as important.  \\n- **Vision, mission and strategy**  \\nFor people at Blendle, it's really important to know why they are doing what they do and what the effect or impact is. You probably constantly think and talk about why and how we do things. Don't forget that your team members often don't have that context. Here are two things to close that gap of information and context.  \\n- **Proactively share what was discussed in high-level meetings.** Also what did we decide not to do and how was the decision made (based on hypotheses or data?).\\n- **Ask your team** if they know **why they are doing** what they're doing.

Do not underestimate the importance of this and the impact it can have on the daily work. Two things you can do:  \\n- Make it a recurring agenda point during retrospectives: how was the vibe during this sprint?\\n- Address it if you feel morale is fading. It can be a red flag.

It also helped us reduce the complexity of the review form and it will make giving feedback easier.  \\n**How do I use it?**  \\nTake a look at [**the Matrix™](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HO4cEH0dguBywUzjT3FMUSGiJbgGjOQDdaILl0BaJME/edit?usp=sharing).** This is a work in progress, but already 90% done.  \\n- Go to the tab (below) with your role (or something related)  \\n![The%20Matrix%E2%84%A2%20(job%20profiles)%2034a96a37d49d41efa24d1184e77c1d8f/Schermafbeelding2018-06-21om15.27.05.png](The%20Matrix%E2%84%A2%20(job%20profiles)%2034a96a37d49d41efa24d1184e77c1d8f/Schermafbeelding2018-06-21om15.27.05.png)  \\n- Scroll through the different areas (work, drive and fit). Drive and fit are the same for everyone. Work is specified per role or discipline.\\n- Per area (work, drive, fit), we came up with really concrete traits (skills, knowledge or behavior). This covers roughly 80%, so feel free to use traits that are not on this list.\\n- We defined what progress would look like on that specific trait. This isn’t a way of defining seniority per se, you can be a ‘level 3’ on one point and ‘level 1’ on the other.  \\nThis will help you to know where you stand in a certain area and it’s now easier to define the steps you can take to improve this.  \\nFor example: If you got the feedback that drive is something you can work on, you are now able to make it more specific by looking at what drive actually means. Is it in the area of ‘Speed = habit and flexible’ or is it about ‘self regulation’?  \\nWe think it will help, but please let me know if that is the case. Really this is up for debate and it should help us get to the overall goals faster. So play around with it and let me know what you think.  \\n**What?**  \\nAs said we came up with 3 categories: **work, drive and fit.** We also use these categories during the hiring process. It's not perfect but it helps us review ourselves and our colleagues. It’s no surprise, then, that we also use it during the feedback cycle. In the beginning of 2017 we started writing down what we think work, drive and fit entail. **Work** is specified per role or expertise. It should cover ~80% of the tasks, skills, knowledge and responsibilities. **Drive** and **Fit** are the same for everyone for now. Drive is about grit, motivation, eagerness, proactiveness, a way of working and a certain mentality and mindset. Fit is about your DNA matching Blendle's DNA and actively working on keeping that match so we stay aligned.  \\nTo help people grow, we pinned down what we believe growth would look like in a specific area or trait.

Less than that is not enough, more than that can happen, just check with your lead if you're in doubt if it's reasonable.\\n- **We stick to the commonly used national holidays**, which comes down to ~8 days per year. We are a startup and there are teams who have work to be done 24/7. We don't like being told whether we are off or not on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of Ramadan) by some rules someone made up, so this is a guideline we use: feel free to work or be off when you want.\\n- Make sure to **take enough moments of rest when you have periods of working hard**. For example: worked a few nights to finish a project? Go home at 12:00 the next Monday to have lunch with a friend and go to the gym (or have a New Girl-marathon). It's about balance and flexibility.\\n- You agree on your time off with your team(lead).\\n- You put your time off in the agenda: add it to your own and all@ agenda.\\n- A life event occurs: communicate what you need and check with your team(lead) when in doubt. 'Hey I just had a baby, won't be at work this week, see you next week. His name is Jan by the way!'.\\n- Enjoy: don't worry if you go to the gym or get a haircut during classic 'work hours'. We trust you to make the best of your days for Blendle.\\n- **This only works when**\\n- Flexibility goes both ways.\\n- You make sure to take enough time off: since you don't get paid at the end of the ride.\\n- You communicate in a crystal clear manner: agreeing the dates with others and putting it in the agenda.\\n- **Backdrop**  \\nThe law and additional ruling tell us what we can and can not do according to time off. We believe that is a very limited way of thinking about time off. We want you to think about what you actually need. Starting with two important pillars:  \\n- We work hard, we need time to reload and rest. Sometimes we work harder, so we need more. Some times we work less, so we need less.\\n- We have something called 'life' happening which means we can't work because we have more important stuff to do.  \\nWe want you to take enough rest to reload and recharge so you can be at your prime when working. Taking enough rest is as important as giving it your all when working. The well known on and off switch.  \\nThe concept of work isn't always caught in time (40 hours) and place. Most of the people at Blendle don't keep track of time because time is such a limited variable to grasp the concept of work. There is a balance to strike here and just looking at hours or a holiday quota limits this discussion.  \\n**That is why we don't keep track of holidays.**  \\nOur people don't have a holiday quota, but a moral obligation to their loved ones and Blendle to work hard and take enough time to rest. Alright, sounds heavy. How does that work?  \\n'Time off' can be divided into two buckets:  \\n1. **Holidays and national holidays**:  \\nYour contract states you have 4 weeks of paid time off per year, by law.  \\nOn average we have 8 national holidays per year. We have no CAO (collective employment agreement), which means you are not entitled to paid time off on every national holiday. We decided to follow the most common situation in an average company, which in practice means most people are off on the big national holidays. But that's your own choice, it's not a right or an obligation, so feel free to improvise. Some teams even have to (editorial and support, for example).  \\nThese rules state that we are off on 'Bevrijdingsdag' once every 5 years. But we aren't allowed time off on Eid al-Fitr (Suikerfeest, ending of the Ramadan). That makes no sense to us.  \\nSo here is how we approach holidays and national holidays in practice.  \\nYou 'have' 5 weeks holiday and ~8 national holidays per year. We want you to use this time off to reload but you decide when and how to consume this. You must also feel free to improvise. You work hard, maybe even a bit too hard, so you might need some extra time off to stay happy and healthy. This also works the other way around: maybe you had a chill quarter and feel no need to take a holiday: feel free to do so. We want you to think about what your body and mind needs instead of your quota.  \\n2. **Life events:**  \\nLife happens. Your cat dies, your car broke, you move to another city, you get married or have kids. Life events which all need your attention. We decided that we are not going to decide for you how much time you **get** for certain events. The question is: how much time do you actually **need.**  \\nMost companies don't give you time off for funerals that are not for immediate relatives. We think we don't need a rule to tell us if that funeral is important for you. So take the time you need.  \\n- Edge cases\\n- Sabbatical: check with HR if you for example have plans to take a very long trip (longer then ~4 weeks).  \\n---  \\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

Welcome to Blendle. Buckle up, you\\'re in for one hell of a ride :).  \\nThe faster you get settled in the better, so we came up with a structure for your first month to make sure you have a smooth start.  \\n- **Structure 1st month**  \\nYour first month is officially your trial period, which means both parties can terminate the contract if we figure out it is a total mismatch. In Blendle history, this happened once. Your first month is **not** an extended hiring process. As you might have noticed, the hiring process was pretty thorough and you made it through. This means we are pretty sure this is a good match. But, life happens so it\\'s good to have a safeguard like the trial period, just don\\'t feel any extra pressure plz.  \\n- **Before day 1:** your contract is signed and all the administrative stuff is taken care of. After that you got your on-boarding e-mail which probably led you here. This e-mail contains all the basic knowledge and acces codes to get you going.\\n- **Day 1:** **Start** around 10:00 (depending on your team, check with them), receive your laptop and Blendle stuff, get settled in (where is the toilet, how does the coffee machine work). Your buddy will get you started in terms of work.  \\nCheck this page to get up to speed on the basics:  \\n[To Do/Read in your first week](To%20Do%20Read%20in%20your%20first%20week%2094048025df6641e4979904a1e35d660b.md)  \\n- **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations [and goals for the 1st month](http://goals.blendle.io/) and the 1st quarter (see below for a structure). Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.\\n- **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).\\n- **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. Your trial period ends and you wrap up your first month together. It\\'s important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Blendle. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1\\'s with your lead.  \\n**Check out our tool** for (personal) goals [here](https://goals.blendle.io).

And don\\'t give up after multiple setbacks :)  \\n**See and seize opportunity\\u2028-** we expect you to see opportunities within Blendle and seize these \\u2028- proactively take on other tasks which you feel benefit our company  \\n**Take ownership \\u2028-** you are responsible for the end result and targets. As they say within Facebook: \"a problem is never someone else\\'s problem\", or as phrased within Booking: \"See a problem, own a problem\" @Jasper Oosterman)  \\n**Focus on impact** \\u2028- your work should contribute to your clear deliverables. With everything you do, think about: does this contribute to my main targets?  \\n**Be ambitious -** aim for the highest\\u2028- we don\\'t ask you to work 80 hours a week, we do ask you to always strive for the best when you are working.

You (and the people you work with) are part of the solution to the problem we are trying to solve. Time lost or wasted is bad, because it doesn’t bring us closer to the goal: supporting quality journalism. We need money to do so. Finding the right product-market fit (building a freaking beautiful product which the whole world wants to use) and becoming profitable is crucial to reaching the end goal.  \\nWe tend to say to people (imagine a smile on our face): ‘Hey, but no pressure!’, and then we both start to laugh (or else it is awkward). Well let me say this once, loud and clear: we realise that there is pressure. It can be pretty intense. This is not a regular corporate day job, and that has its up- and downsides. Example upside: we don’t care where and when you work, which means flexibility. Example downside: you have to be able to regulate yourself, which can be hard.  \\nThere are a lot of product/business choices made because of this survival mode. Some you might like (a lot of freedom and responsibility in your work), some you might dislike (pressure on shipping, for example). **Bottom line: survival mode results in a fast-paced, high-pressure, sometimes hectic/chaotic environment.**  \\nWe trust you to keep this in mind along this rollercoaster ride called Blendle.

The fact that we are a fast-paced startup with an aim to save journalism is not something that will change any time soon. This also means that we are facing a runway, which affects our everyday work. This is fuelling us to go the extra mile, but the downsides are also obvious.  \\nSo what can Blendle do?  \\n- **Voicing vision & mission more:** everybody should feel connected to where Blendle is going and why. Talking about this more will help everybody align. This way everybody has more influence on the direction and it is more clear why a change of direction is made and how this affects your work.\\n- Open channels: **work on transparency and trust**: everybody should be able to speak up if they feel that the stress level is too high. Also when someone feels like they aren’t in the right role or simply doing work they don’t love everyday.\\n- **Build an environment which is less stressful.** This piece is step 1 on this point. Notice when people work too much. Tell people if we notice it and tell them to take action (go home, take holiday, work less, talk to someone). Let’s also keep improving the process we have in place for when people feel it’s too much.\\n- **Keep jobs fun:** Blendle has the unique opportunity to let people work on things they love and are good at. We have to make sure that we guard that. Roles will evolve and let’s keep an eye out for people growing in a direction they might end up hating.\\n- **Educate:** we should include this topic in the first month (onboarding) and help people regulate their work even more. For example the Getting Things Done method. It wasn’t made to get people to work harder and more, it was made to get people to work better and feel less stressed. Within Blendle it can be hard to regulate yourself. We need to be able to help people who struggle with planning, prioritizing, saying no and setting boundaries.\\n- **Feedback and praise:** keep working on the feedback cycle and don’t forget to include praise. Let’s also work on making sure everybody knows what is expected of them.\\n- **Create awareness** within teams and team leads:  \\nAre you giving regular feedback?  \\nAre you giving praise?  \\nAre you actively challenging your team?  \\nAre you listening to what they want and are you voicing that to others?  \\nAre you involving your team in the Blendle mission (is it clear)?  \\nIs your schedule (and that of your team) in a healthy rhythm (work-life balance)? You set the example.  \\nIs your team taking regular holidays/long weekends?  \\nHere’s an article about how to help your team with this:  \\n[Help Your Team Manage Stress, Anxiety, and Burnout](https://hbr.org/2016/01/help-your-team-manage-stress-anxiety-and-burnout?utm_source=All+Poynter+Subscribers&utm_campaign=375ceb2697-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_04_12&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_5372046825-375ceb2697-257900805)  \\n- **Look out for each other:** there is no official peer program (not yet), so we have to look out for each other. Ask each other questions and be candid to each other if you hear red flags.\\n- **Hiring**: we should keep hiring great, talented people who will give us energy, ideas and of course are fun to work with.  \\nThat’s it folks. Let’s get this conversation going.  \\nIf you are struggling with this now (try the self test) and you recognize the symptoms you might have read in the articles: let us know. Talk to someone.

Also tell your team. Also tell HR.\\n- Come up with a concrete 2 week plan (we can help you with that) to release some of the first pressure. This will mean a less busy sprint, shorter days, and maybe 2 weeks of 4 days to start with (or a holiday). The hours you gain, you can spend on things you enjoy and help you reload (Netflix, sports, cinema, go to the beach, visit friends, play with model trains). We learned that just doing nothing, doesn’t always help, so make sure to spend time on things you like.\\n- During these two weeks you check in with your team lead how your stress level is. You can make it really concrete by giving your stress level a number (1-10).\\n- Once you feel reloaded, we (you, teamlead and HR if you like) need to talk about the factors that caused your stress level to rise and see how we can prevent this from happening again.\\n- I’m not good. I recognize the symptoms and I’m on the verge of burning out.\\n- Don’t wait, speak up now. Tell your team lead, tell Rolo/HR.\\n- We have (external) professionals who are experts on this topic. We can put you in touch with them. They know Blendle and the environment and they will be able to get you back on track. Our advice would be to talk to us first, but if you feel you can’t do that for whatever reason: contact Martijn ten Bokum from Arbobutler: m.ten.bokum@arbobutler.nl.\\n- Depending on your case and your problems, we (together with the people from Arbobutler) come up with a tailor made plan, based on what you need.

       " Document(page_content=\"You can start with dividing your life into different parts. Think of: family, work, colleagues, sports, hobby, voluntary work. Once you have a clear overview of all the different areas, think about whether it adds to your stress level and if there are ways to change things. Let's zoom in a bit further:  \\n**Private life**  \\nMaybe you are in the middle of moving into your dream house or you are trying to get your house sold. Maybe you become a mom or dad, or maybe you really want to. Maybe you just got married or you just went through a rough break up. Maybe you have a lot of debts which are hard to get rid off. Maybe you have an addiction you are struggling with. Maybe you lost someone you love. Whatever it is: it affects your meter and it adds up.  \\nMapping this out and being aware of this already helps. When becoming aware of a big thing which adds to our stress level, we can see if we can try to fix it. This will not work for everything — of course, life sucks sometimes. But when in the midst of moving to another house, why not take 2 weeks off and really get it done instead of doing it beside your demanding job? Even the harder obstacles can be worked on. Start by going to the doctor, marriage counseling or a psychologist. It won’t ‘fix’ the problem instantly of course, but it’s a start. And again: sometimes life sucks.  \\n**Blendle life**  \\n- Working at a startup in survival mode (shifting directions, runway, fixing the product, changing teams)\\n- Your personal development (new role, changing responsibilities, not a set-in-stone job description)\\n- Everything happening around you (people leaving and joining, people taking on new responsibilities, changing PM’s and teamleads).  \\nWe know this adds to your tally. Again, just becoming aware of this already helps.  \\nAnd also again, when you see something causing a lot of stress, let’s get to work on it. Not digging the new team structure? Not feeling your current role? Not happy with your team lead? Bring it up with someone you trust (HR, your team lead, Alexander, just anyone) and let’s try to fix it or at least talk about it.  \\nBlendle cares. We care. So if you’re struggling, let’s change things to make sure you are happy, healthy and at your best.\", metadata={'Header 1': '2. Be aware'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"- **Look at your work life balance**  \\n> In engineering, people talk about asset integrity, which means that you service the machinery before it breaks. In modern organizations, the work is thinking and the machinery is your brain. We know from cognitive science that there are hard limits to what the brain can deal with. And yet, there’s an awful lot in the way we work which flies in the face of that. We think that if we work through the night, we’re being very clever. We’re not. We think we can work long hours — month after month, year after year — and that there won’t be any wear and tear. But there is.\\n>  \\n[Career advice for millennials (and really, anyone) from Margaret Heffernan](http://blog.ted.com/career-advice-for-millennials-and-really-anyone-from-margaret-heffernan/)  \\nYes, as we now know there is a lot more to it than just taking holidays and working less. You could still feel stressed working 20 hours. Looking at the time spent on work and time spent on your personal life is a pretty good start and good for everybody (also when you don’t feel stressed. Let’s try to prevent it).  \\n- **Take freedom and responsibility: find the right rhythm**  \\nWe are a company with flexible working hours. This freedom comes with a responsibility. When we say that, a lot of people assume that they need to work a lot and really hard in exchange for that freedom. That is not what we are trying to say.  \\n**You have the responsibility to find out what rhythm works for you best, to be at your best.** Simply because we believe not everybody works the same way. So do you have the rhythm which works best for you? We want everybody to be able to bring their child, cat or car to daycare. Not because we love cats in particular (yes we do), but we want nothing to get in your way of getting the most out of your day. The fact that we don’t care when and how many times you go to a doctor, psych or barber is not because we want to be the ‘cool employer’, but because you need your health to add value that day. So if that means visiting the barber once a week on Monday morning: please do.  \\nSo have you found your rhythm yet? Rolo hates traffic jams so you’ll see him coming and going at exotic times. Alex is scrolling through his Twitter feed till late at night so you won't see him before 11:00 at the office. Rick’s alarm clock is set at 6:00 and we know he doesn’t snooze, so he’s in at 8:00, leaving early to have dinner with his wife.  \\nIt might help announcing changes in your rythm to your team. It makes it feel legit for you, and your team members can help you with it.  \\nWhen rethinking your rhythm, keep this in mind:  \\n- **It is impossible to work 60 hours productively over a longer period of time.** It hurts you and Blendle to work that much. If you are able to work 8 productive hours a day you should be proud of that. Sometimes it will be 6, sometimes 10: relax, it’s okay, You’re not working in a factory with time stamps.\\n- Be flexible. Some days you just don’t have it. **You are not a machine.** Of course, first you’ll take a walk and grab a double espresso or a Club Mate, but if that doesn’t work it’s okay. Go home. Go to the gym. Go play with your kid. Go kiting. Go for a walk in the forest. Anything, just don’t sit behind your desk to ‘make the hours’. That’s not helping anybody.\\n- Working at home vs. at Blendle HQ. Try to strike a **balance between home/office**. Meetings and brainstorms are best done face to face but a day of deep work is best done in a cafe or on an abandoned island with 4g.\\n- **Rotate, change your pace.** During the summer it can be nice to start at 6:30 and bike to the beach at 15.00h. During the winter, every morning might feel like a small hangover and you stroll into HQ at 10:00 after your first 2 cups of coffee.\\n- **Take care of your body and mind**  \\n**Take holidays and days off.**  \\nThis one seems obvious, but we know it’s not. We believe that working at Blendle is the Premier League, the creme de la creme :). That takes it’s toll and asks a lot from your body and mind. These two need time to recharge from your efforts. Make sure to build in moments of absolute rest during the year. It’s called a holiday. Make sure to take 4 weeks, and make sure at least 2 of those are in a row. Advice would be to really go away: studies show that this works best. There are some studies showing that taking regular holidays (every quarter) are very effective. So don’t wait 6 months to take 2 weeks. Also take a week every now and then.  \\n**Don’t work when you’re sick**  \\nWhen you have the flu, stay at home. Get back to work when you are fully recovered. Don’t feel guilty about it (easier said than done, we know). Yes we miss you, but we can do it without you for a few days. Even better: with you being away, your team might have to rethink how certain things are done in your absence. It can cause a new (maybe better) way for tasks and responsibilities to be distributed and single points of failure can be discovered and fixed.  \\n**Food and exercise**  \\nCrucial to feeling well, is taking care of your body. Studies show that exercise is crucial when having a demanding job. That doesn’t mean we want you all to be fitgirls and fitboys. But: get moving. Go skating, hiking, biking, surfing, do yoga. Do something. Your body isn’t made to sit in a chair all day. Use the facilities at the office (standing desks and desk bikes) and try to go for a walk every day (is the 1on1-walk a thing yet?). The things you consume also affect this of course, no secrets there. Take care of yourself by consuming good stuff. No rocket science: just more veggies and water, less alcohol and smoking. Take care of yourself.  \\n**When something is wrong: go see a doctor:**  \\nDon’t wait too long to go see a doctor or therapist. It’s very normal to talk to a psychologist or coach every once in awhile. Just as normal as visiting a physiotherapist for back pain because you have an office job.  \\n- **Setting priorities right and saying no (I know this is hard)**  \\n1. You, your family, friends and loved ones\\n2. Blendle  \\nIt’s important to know what the right order is. Your health comes first. Your loved ones come first. We want you to pay attention to your number 1 priority and have your private life in order. Because if it’s not, it will add to your stress level.  \\nHow does that look? Sometimes it’s better to skip a morning stand-up to visit a physio for your constant headache. You are acting in Blendle’s interest when doing this.  \\n- **Check your work, job and role**  \\nAre you doing the right job? Do you get energy from what you are doing? Do you feel like you’re making a difference? Do you love most of it? Of course there will be stuff you don’t like, that’s totally normal. But are you doing things you are good at and you like? And is there enough challenge, perspective and room to grow?  \\nAre you getting enough praise and feedback? Do you know what is expected from you? Do you know how you are doing at the moment?  \\nIt’s really important that you know how your team and team leads think you are doing. Ask them! What are you doing well, what needs to improve. Use the structure we came up with: 1on1’s, personal goals, feedback sessions, peer reviews. But feel free to alter them in order for them to work for you. Just don’t do nothing.  \\n- **Last but not least: get informed.**  \\nThere is a lot of information out there. Inform yourself. It will help you recognize a potential threat earlier and help you act on that.  \\nGoing to the [**Good Reads**](https://www.notion.so/Good-reads-db93e669c7014162a85c5932512d57c7?pvs=21) page is a great place to start :).  \\n**Keep reading, [here's what Blendle can do.](https://www.notion.so/What-can-Blendle-do-b75846253cf2456d817f1d3b475dc8ab?pvs=21) >>>**\", metadata={'Header 1': '3.

So there is never one thing that will push you over the edge. It’s always a combination. A cocktail.  \\nLet’s start with a few quotes from people who had a burnout. This might not resonate with you directly because you may not feel like this. But this is to give you a grasp of how it feels when it’s been too much.  \\n> “It’s not just having too much to do, it’s having committed to doing more than you know you have time for. It’s committing to things you know at the time you won’t be able to get to, but another voice in your head says, ‘I’ll make it work somehow.’”\\n>  \\n> “Different people manifest burnout in different ways, but I think for all of us, it’s some variety of a shutdown,” she says. Parts of your personality start to contract. Your range of expression shrinks. Your world view narrows.”\\n>  \\n[Practical Frameworks for Beating Burnout](http://firstround.com/review/practical-frameworks-for-beating-burnout/)  \\n> “Suddenly without direction, I started feeling more and more disconnected. My work was no longer motivating, and it became harder and harder to stay focused. I felt like I was failing – like I should be able to make things work, but for some reason, I couldn’t.”\\n>  \\n> “I wasn’t overworked, but I was exhausted all the time. I couldn’t concentrate on my work – even simple tasks like responding to emails felt monumental. I was only able to work at a mere fraction of what I knew I was capable of. Things that used to be easy were almost impossible. I was plagued with insomnia, and found myself forgetting meals. My creativity had vanished – I could barely even respond to emails, let alone design a product.”\\n>  \\n> “Joyful activities, like playing with my infant daughter, suddenly felt like an obligation and a chore.”\\n>  \\n[Recovering from Burnout](https://kierantie.com/a/burnout/)  \\nSo I hope this helps you grasp how you might feel when it’s already too much. If you feel like ‘omg this is me’, that is a red flag…  \\nAfter a lot of reading and talking to people, I made a list of red flags that kept popping up:  \\n**Symptoms you can look for by yourself** (this is really different for everybody and therefore not list you can cross off)  \\n- It’s hard to concentrate over a longer period of time\\n- Irritated and agitated (easily)\\n- Emotional (more than normal, often on moments you don’t expect it)\\n- Trouble sleeping (falling asleep but also sleeping through)\\n- It’s hard to put things in perspective (it’s all big, heavy and important)\\n- Low energy and not in the mood to do stuff (you would normally do)\\n- You don’t enjoy things (starting with your work, but even your food might taste bad)\\n- Depressing and anxious thoughts\\n- Physical manifestations of stress: palpitations, hyperventilation, headaches, constipation\\n- Trouble remembering stuff (you forget things more than usual)\\n- Compulsive behaviour increases (addictions and ticks)  \\n**In your job you could look at the following:**  \\n- **Work-life balance:** not working too much and really ‘tuning out’ when not working (no slack, mail or even Twitter with colleagues). Spending time with loved ones, investing in personal relationships and hobbies. Read more about why this is so important:  \\n[Diversify Your Identity](https://markmanson.net/diversify-your-identity)  \\n- **Being happy with (believing in)** the direction the company is going. Do not underestimate how this effects you. Try speaking up if you feel like you are disconnected to the overall goals, beliefs, direction, mission and vision. Especially because it changes all the time.\\n- After being ‘on your toes’ for a while, you have **time to recover.** Not having the ‘it’s never done or good enough’ feeling.\\n- **Good relationships** with colleagues and team lead: having the feeling you can speak up and share doubts and/or troubles.\\n- **Influence and freedom** in the work you do.\\n- Feel that **your work matters** and has **impact**.\\n- Working in **a role that fits** you (doing work you like and you are good at and work on things you love).  \\nThis is just an outline and it isn’t meant to be complete. We have a lot of different characters at Blendle, but we do attract a certain type of person. This person usually has a big feeling of responsibility and a big drive and ambition. This type of person in particular is vulnerable to stress:  \\n> “In a way it’s ironic that this problem plagues Type-A players the most. The people who want to do their best and accomplish the most end up limiting themselves unintentionally. In startup culture, this usually manifests in people trying to have peak performance at work while also going to all the social events and being great to their families at the same time. Then they’re hard on themselves for not getting perfect marks in every category. As soon as they meet their own bar, they raise it.”\\n>  \\n[Practical Frameworks for Beating Burnout](http://firstround.com/review/practical-frameworks-for-beating-burnout/)  \\nAlright, so here we are: we now know we have a potentially dangerous environment (startup, fast paced, a lot of changes, a lot of freedom, not always clear structure) and we attract certain type of people: responsible, perfectionist, driven, ambitious and hard on themselves.', metadata={'Header 1': 'Work at Blendle'}),\n",

We encourage you to talk about what happened.  \\nIf you are being sexually harassed (or suspect another person is being harassed), please report it to HR, your lead or [our outside confidential counsellor](https://www.notion.so/ceb925ba799f4dcab14bee5af3ffc0b8?pvs=21).

If you suspect that an offender doesn’t realise they are guilty of harassment, you could talk to them directly in an effort to resolve the issue. This tactic is appropriate for cases of minor harassment (e.g. inappropriate jokes between colleagues, something you read on #overheard).\\n- **Talk to your team lead**. Your team lead will assess your situation and may contact HR if appropriate. Explain the situation in as much detail as possible. If you have any hard evidence (e.g. emails), forward it or bring it with you to the meeting.\\n- **Talk to HR**. Feel free to reach out to HR in any case of harassment no matter how minor it may seem. For your safety, contact HR as soon as possible in cases of serious harassment (e.g. sexual advances) or if your team lead is involved in your claim. Anything you disclose will remain confidential.\\n- **Talk to a confidential counsellor**. If for any reason you don't want to talk to HR or your team lead directly, you can choose to talk to our outside counsellor. We appointed one in November 2018. The outside counsellor can listen to you and advise you on possible next steps. Again, you will always be in the lead on next steps. The content of your conversation will always stay confidential and will not reach Blendle or the offender.

Here are some pointers you can use.  \\n- Be honest during the screening and **express your doubts**: \"I think you are too experienced based on your resume.\" or \"I think your skill set is not a match, but maybe you did some hobby project you can tell me about because the rest is a perfect match.\"\\n- **Salary expectation:** how much are you currently making?

Everybody should have a rating 1-3 on Work Drive and Fit + reasoning.  \\nThe meeting format: *on the count of three* show 1, 2 or 3 fingers for Work (your rating). Discuss the ratings.

And to understand under what circumstances a candidate thrives or doesn\\'t.  \\n**How:**  \\nThe hiring manager or the hiring team will contact references before proceeding. Ask for references at the end of the pair day. You should check them before making an offer. Try at least 2 references. Write a short report of the conversation in github or homerun.  \\n**Questions you can as a reference are for example:**  \\n- Can you describe your working relationship with this person?\\n- What is he/she like to work with?\\n- What can he/she improve upon?\\n- What advice would you give his/her next hiring manager?\\n- Would you rehire this person?  \\nHere is [a nice guideline](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-make-better-reference-calls-d493a12714f0) on reference check.  \\nYou can also use questions that might have arisen after the pair day. You should NOT ask any questions about the person\\'s race, gender, sexual preference, disabilities or health, political affiliations, religion, or family (children). All reference check feedback should be entered into github or homerun.  \\n- ***Optional: extra step***  \\nWhen there are doubts, it\\'s usually a no hire. When the doubts are not based on solid findings, you could consider taking an extra step.  \\n- Doubt on fit: consider having a beer/ice tea with someone on a different location.\\n- Doubt on work: consider sharing your thoughts with the candidate and ask how/she could convince you. Could be another interview with a senior person within Blendle or another assignment.\\n- Doubt on drive: this is probably a no.  \\n- 6**. Offer and closing**  \\n**Who is responsible**: hiring manager/teamlead and HR  \\n**Who is involved**: hiring manager/teamlead and HR  \\n**Timing follow-up:** asap  \\n**Goal:** make a fair offer and close  \\n**Note:** hiring manager = teamlead and is by default in the lead in this process. If you feel like it\\'s better if HR or someone else does the offer: do so.  \\n**How:**  \\n1. **Determine offer:** hiring manager and HR determine salary offer together.  \\nWe weigh in several variables:  \\n- **Benchmark:** internal and external.  \\nThe most accurate way to determine the range where someone should be is comparing someone with a peer internally. During the hiring process you find out at what level someone is and you\\'ll be able to compare him or her internally. Who would you compare this person too in terms of level? Is he/she better than X? If you notice that everyone is not as good as the people we have, but are paid more: think about raising the salary of our people. Keep in mind that - especially in tech - the market is on tilt. Big corporate pay a lot of money to even mediocre people in tech. We don\\'t want to compete with them and that is a choice for new hires to make.  \\n- **Classic figures:** age, experience, education, specific knowledge and expertise.  \\nThis is a bit old school, but also at Blendle there is a difference between someone who is 20 years of age with no experience or 30 with 8 years experience. For some jobs/roles we need certain skills, expertise or even education. This always comes with a price tag.  \\n- **Scarcity & market value**  \\nIt\\'s fair to say that is harder to find an iOS engineer than an HR officer. Good people are always hard to find, but we have to take into account that certain disciplines are paid a bit more because of what the market does.  \\n- **Role and responsibilities**  \\nCertain roles and people make more impact then others. This is reflected in pay.  \\n- **Actual impact and contribution**  \\nSince we don\\'t really like job titles, it\\'s good to look at someones actual impact and contribution. What difference will this person make or is this person really making?  \\n- **Someone\\'s starting point**  \\nIf we hire new people, they will have a job. To get them to work at Blendle, we need to offer a competitive salary. We have to take this into account.  \\n*Note: all of this is not an exact science and is determined together, so please: ask for help.*  \\n2**. Call candidate** with the good news.

Attached you’ll find our template contract.  \\n**- Salary:** €XXXX,- per month, before tax.  \\n**- Holiday pay**: 8%, paid in may  \\nPerks and benefits  \\n- **Travel expenses:** by default we will get you a fancy NS business card with a subscription that suits your situation best. If you come by car, we’ll pay you €0,19 per kilometer, but within limits.\\n- **Telephone costs/reimbursements:** if you need to make a lot of phone calls for Blendle, we’ll reimburse your costs. Same goes for other costs.\\n- **Pension:** we facilitate pensions via [Bright Pensioen](https://brightpensioen.nl/). Bright is not your standard pension plan. We think it’s better than the mandatory corporate pension scheme which you might be used to. [This video](https://youtu.be/xfZM2JuovJM?t=1941) explains a bit about pensions in general and it starts at the point where they explain what Bright Pensioen is and why we chose it. At the moment Blendle can’t afford a full blown pension plan, but we want to do what we can. That’s why Blendle pays the costs to Bright, so the money you put aside, goes straight to your pension. I also attached a presentation Bright did at Blendle.\\n- **Option plan:** there is an Option plan. Options are worth a lot for us, because it is the most precious thing we have: a part of our company. So we don’t hand them out by default, we just want you to know it’s there and that we can explain the details to you later if you want.\\n- **Laptop:** a good laptop is important, so you get one from us. Special needs? Let me know.\\n- **Equipment:** we have electric sit-stand-desks and good chairs so your back stays in shape and there are more than enough screens and additional equipment at the office.\\n- **Massages:** once a week, our masseuse gets rid of all our stress with her chair massages.\\n- **Lunch/diner/food/drinks**: Blendle will make sure to keep your engine running by taking care of food (lunch/dinner/snacks) and drinks. Let us know if you have special needs/allergies.\\n- **Headspace/Things**: to keep your head in shape, we pay for the best apps to help you do so: [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), to stay calm and mindful and [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/), to boost your productivity and help you reach your goals.\\n- **Fitness subscription** with discount: to keep your body in shape we arranged a nice discount at a [local gym](http://www.deworkout.nl/).\\n- **Blendle Premium:** we’ll hook you up with a Blendle Premium subscription.\\n- **Budget for study/courses/books/learning** etc.: there is money on our bank account and it’s up to us to spend wisely. So yes, there is budget. Just let us know if you think it’s reasonable if Blendle pitches in.\\n- **Blendle outings:** the party agenda is pretty full. You’ll be invited when there is a party ahead.\\n- **Holidays:** At Blendle, HR doesn\\'t keep track of your holidays and we don\\'t \\'pay out\\' at the end of the ride. When in doubt: 4-6 weeks is a good bandwidth. Less than that is not enough, more than that can happen, just check with your lead if you\\'re in doubt if it\\'s reasonable.  \\nCheers,  \\nName  \\n4. **Get a yes** and let HR do the rest.  \\n- **Onboarding**  \\nHR will get your new colleague up-and-running in no time.

This should scare the bejeezus out of you.\\n>  \\nYears of interviewing experience and research taught us a few things. Embed these pointers in your interviewing and you\\'ll notice right away. No-good money back.  \\n- **Structured interviews** vs. winging it.  \\nAn unstructured interview (winging it) is a very poor way of gathering information for a hiring decision. You should approach this talk with a strategy. What are you hoping to get out of the meeting and how are you going to get it?  \\nIt starts at the moment you and your team decided to hire someone. That\\'s the point you come up with a solid profile, with both hard, concrete as soft and abstract requirements. This profile should lead your questioning.  \\nKeep in mind that an interview is not the best predictor for future succes and not the best way to see if someone is actually good at their job. That\\'s why we do assignments and pair sessions. With that knowledge you can focus on the more abstract and soft stuff which is impossible to measure with an assignment.  \\nHere\\'s a basic structure that could help you and cover the basics, but make sure to actually prepare your interviews, don\\'t wing it. You\\'re wasting someone\\'s time if you do.  \\nHere\\'s an outline, you can shuffle the blocks of course. At Blendle we like a pretty loose style of interviewing, so freewheel within the structure, just make sure you tick the most important boxes. It\\'s a compass, not a GPS.  \\nI**ntro (3 min)**  \\n→ Create relaxed atmosphere. Chitchat, but don\\'t overdo it.  \\n**Talk about Blendle  (10 min)**  \\n→ Sell the Blendle story, answer questions.  \\n**Talk about resume (5 min)**  \\n→ Keep it short, ask if someone can give you a 1 minutes pitch about their resume (since you already read it). This is a nice start because people expect this, so they can get in their flow before you really dig in.  \\n**Talk about the job (10 min)**  \\n→ Explain the role, the position, the responsibilities, the challenges and answer questions. Check if someone really understands and is still interested.  \\n**Check work/drive/fit (25 min)**  \\n→ Check work (is someone capable of doing the job? Does he/she have the right skills, knowledge, expertise and experience)  \\n→ Check drive (is someone eager, ambitious and willing? Is someone motivated to work for Blendle?)  \\n→ Check fit (would someone fit in the current team and company? DNA/culture match?)  \\n*More on how to get answers on this in the block below (ask good questions).*  \\n**Practical questions (5 min)**  \\n→ Make sure there are no practical roadblocks like travel time, availability, money or working hours.  \\n**Outro (5 min)**  \\n→ Check if there are any more questions and tell candidate about the further process.  \\n- **Ask good questions** (and listen).  \\nAsking good questions can be hard, so think about this when preparing your interview. This mainly applies to the section where you check work, drive and fit (also the three things you will be rating when making a decision).  \\nWe recommend you come up with your own set and testing them out. What questions \\'work\\' and which one don\\'t? Share this with your hiring team! It\\'s not per se a bad idea to ask the same kind of question to a person several times by several people.  \\nUse the art of listening and follow up questions. Short questions like: can you elaborate on that? Why? Can you give an example? What effect did that have? How would you approach that situation now? What other options did you have? What happened? How? Can you explain?  \\n**Types of questions.**  \\nThere are different types of questions. Experiment with different types of questioning.  \\n[The Eight Types of Interview Questions](https://collegegrad.com/jobsearch/mastering-the-interview/the-eight-types-of-interview-questions)  \\nResearch shows that **case, behavioral and competency** questions scored best on validity, so try to focus on those types of questions.  \\n**Case:** Share a real Blendle-life problem with a candidate and aks how someone would solve or approach it.  \\n**Behavioral:** Ask about former behavior to predict future behavior. For example: What is your biggest mistake over the past year? What happened and how did you deal with it?  \\n**Competency:** Ask a question which reveals expertise, knowledge or skills, for example for a support person: Tell me about a situation where a customer got really angry, what did you do?  \\n**Overall questions**  \\nWhat are you most proud of in life?  \\nWhat is the last book you read?  \\nWhat do you like to spend your time on aside from work?  \\nHow do you measure succes?  \\nCan you give an example of a situation where you used data to ground a decision?  \\n**Work question** (these of course differ per role)  \\nOverall work questions:  \\nWhat was your biggest achievement at your former job?  \\nWhat kind of things do you really dislike to do? Why?  \\nWhat is your biggest mistake over the past year? What happened and how did you deal with it?  \\nYou get to organise an event, which two/three people in your field of expertise would you invite to give a talk?  \\nWhat are your go-to platforms for staying up to date?  \\nWhat do you think your first 30 days would look like in this role?  \\n*Now try tailoring some questions to the profile you\\'re looking for.*  \\nFor example for PM\\'s:  \\nWhat do you think Blendle\\'s 3 most important metrics are?  \\nIf you could make one change to Blendle\\'s new iOS app, what would you change?  \\nWhat do you think of the current proposition?  \\nDo you communicate differently with designers than you do with engineers? What’s the difference?  \\nCan you give an example of a time where you had a hard time working with your team and how you fixed that?  \\n**Drive questions** (these apply to all roles)  \\nWhat makes you get up out of bed every morning? What makes you tick?  \\nIf you would have your own company, what would it do/make/create?  \\nWhat kind of topics are you really passionate about? Sport, economics...  \\nIf you had no financial incentive (because you won the lottery) to work, how would you spend your days?  \\nWhat do you do to get better? What do you need from us to improve?  \\nWhat things are you trying to improve in?  \\nTell me about your biggest bold bet, how did it play out?  \\nWhy are you quitting your current job?  \\n**Fit questions (these apply to all roles)**  \\nHow do you like to collaborate? What are you looking for in your new colleagues?  \\nWhat do you need to perform at your best? To shine? How do we motivate you and what environment do you need?  \\nHow do you deal with an ever-changing environment?  \\nWhere are you going to work if this conversation doesn\\'t work out?  \\nWhat do you expect from working at a startup?  \\nCan you tell me about a time you disagreed with a colleague or lead?  \\n**No go\\'s:**  \\nTry to stay away from standard questions  \\n- **Take notes**  \\n\\'Duhhhh\\'.  \\nI still see people not taking notes and it\\'s frustrating because your wasting everyone\\'s time. Without notes, all you have to go on is your - pretty biased - memory and gut feeling. You prepared your interview, so write down the answers you get on the questions you thought were crucial to ask. You can use this in during the decisions and actually give examples: \\'When I asked X, she answered Y and that testifies that she really understands the concept and did her homework\\'.  \\n- **Use Ratings**  \\nRatings quantify the unquantifiable. Force yourself to chose and try to come up with an explanation for that rating. We rate from 1-3 and rate on Work, Drive and fit.\\nUse the profile you made, your notes, the matrix and your overall findings to explain your ratings if need be.  \\n- **Reduce bias**  \\nEveryone is biased.  \\nYour bias doesn\\'t help you make good decisions and evaluate a person.  \\nYou can reduce bias by:  \\n1. **Awareness:**  \\nJust keep in mind that you and your colleagues - for example - have the tendency to like people who are like you (same former employer, education, village or even hobby: similarity bias). It\\'s also pretty clear people tend to like pretty people more (beauty bias). Just keep stuff like that in the back of your mind and check yourself and your colleagues.  \\n2. **Standardise:**  \\nStructure and recurring processes reduce bias. For example: if you are in awe of someone, you might want to skip that extra step or test because you assume he/she will nail it (halo effect). Or you could be more harsh in your questioning or reviewing because you already think someone is not a good match (conformation bias). Do the same thing for everyone and you get the best comparison.  \\n3. **Use ratings and justify**  \\nQuantify your feeling about a candidate by giving ratings and build a good argumentation around it. Question each other on the ratings. Why did you give this candidate a 2. What should he/she have done for you to make it a 3?  \\n4. **The hiring team**  \\nBring in enough people - with different views and opinions - to make sure you reduce bias to the max.  \\n[5 Keys to Hiring the Best Candidate-Not the One Your Brain Wants to Trick You Into Picking](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-keys-to-hiring-the-best-candidatenot-the-one-your-brain-wants-to-trick-you-into-picking)  \\n[9 Types of Unconscious Bias and the Shocking Ways They Affect Your Recruiting Efforts](https://www.socialtalent.com/blog/recruitment/9-types-of-unconscious-bias)  \\n- **Two way street: sell it.**  \\n[Hiring is your brand: 9 small things to improve your interview process](https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/hiring-is-your-brand-9-small-things-to-improve-your-interview-process-142286cc13e0)  \\nSure, you are interviewing this person and it\\'s your goal to be able to judge this person, but it\\'s crucial you do this very subtly. Here are a few tips that might help.  \\n- **Let go of the structure.** Your a human, not a pre-programmed robot ;). Let the conversation happen and use the structure as a compass to make sure you cover everything. The most practical tip is to leave room for questions or to simply start explaining something from your side (just how you would do it when you\\'re having a beer with someone). Try to feed information, even when you asked the questions up front and leave room for a question after that.\\n- **Asking hard questions:** good people want to be assessed properly. This reflects on their feelings about Blendle and increases the chances of them seeing it as a real opportunity.\\n- **Practice your pitch.** Use the interview to get to know what makes someone want to work at Blendle. Elaborate on that and practice your pitch about what Blendle is doing and why that is important. Also think about why you want to work at Blendle and just share your thoughts about the up and downsides. What motivates you to work here?\\n- **Be fierce, don\\'t be tricked.**  \\nCheck this:  \\n[The Best Way to Answer Interview Questions About You](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/how-to-answer-interview-questions-about-you-2061269)  \\nThis is a website with a list of the most asked questions by recruiters + some pretty good answers. People can study for an interview. Don\\'t be tricked. If someone is making claims or telling you about a certain experience, be sure to use follow-up questions to discover the truth. Candidates tend to brag a bit, keep that in mind. Was it really that person\\'s idea? Was someone the lead of 3 interns or 3 senior people? There\\'s a difference.  \\n- **Good reads**  \\n[My Lessons from Interviewing 400+ Engineers Over Three Startups](http://firstround.com/review/my-lessons-from-interviewing-400-engineers-over-three-startups/)  \\n[Why Use Performance-Based Hiring When Building Your Startup | Hubgets](https://www.hubgets.com/blog/use-performance-based-hiring-building-startup-team/)  \\n[The 2-Question Performance-based Interview, Part 1](https://www.ere.net/the-2-question-performance-based-interview-part-1/)  \\n[How to Conduct a Job Interview](https://www.inc.com/guides/2010/04/conducting-job-interviews.html)  \\n[Hiring is your brand: 9 small things to improve your interview process](https://medium.com/@gerstenzang/hiring-is-your-brand-9-small-things-to-improve-your-interview-process-142286cc13e0)  \\n---  \\nIf you want to work at Blendle you can check our [job ads here](https://blendle.homerun.co/).

The rest of the week I start at around 09:30. Before that I\\'m spending time meditating or playing with my daughter.\\n- I go home between 18:00 and 19:00, often doing some work or reading on the train. When I\\'m home I rarely work in the evenings.\\n- On the weekends and during holidays I rarely work.\\n- I work from home on Tuesdays. Working from home gives me a lot of focus, and makes it easier to spend the time on deep work being less distracted (this user guide was written on a Tuesday).  \\n**Best way to communicate with me**  \\n- Most important: I live in my calendar. It tells me what to do. All the rest comes second.\\n- Personal\\n- I use email for work stuff.\\n- I enjoy instant messaging a lot for personal stuff.\\n- But when you try to make an appointment with me, I respond better to email (as it\\'s going to be easier to turn it into a calendar event).\\n- I enjoy calling to chat about nothing.\\n- Work\\n- Email me. It\\'s the center of my communications. It\\'s easy for me to turn emails in to-do\\'s. I have (and need) a system for follow up reminders, otherwise I lose track of if I need a reply from someone. (One of the reasons I hate phone conversations or instant messaging about work).\\n- I don\\'t need acknowledgements of emails like \"got it\" or \"on it\". I expect you have read my email within a couple of days (except when you\\'re on holiday).\\n- Only contact me by phone or instant message (telegram, whatsapp, slack, sms) when it\\'s urgent, work related stuff. If you call me, I\\'m going to assume it\\'s an emercency. And if that\\'s the case, by all means, feel free to call me.\\n- I prefer to discuss things in real life, instead over email.\\n- I like the direct approach. Give it to me straight.\\n- I don\\'t expect you to respond immediately when I send you something by email. Even when I send you the mail at night. However, I do expect you to close the loop on everything we open. I will do the same, but try to take things that are in your function off my plate and into your to do-list. I get frustrated when I have to ask about something twice.\\n- Don\\'t say \"let\\'s discuss\" without a follow-up of when we\\'ll discuss.\\n- I\\'m super interested in why you believe what you believe. Help us build these contexts by over-communicating. Share your logic, particularly when we\\'re building trust. It\\'s even more important when we\\'re just getting to know each other.  \\n**Meetings**  \\n- 1:1\\'s and office hours\\n- 1:1\\'s and office hours are mostly your time. Spend them however you like. I can talk about anything to you, from questions about work, the company, it\\'s strategy, your personal life, your personal development or your interests. I might take 10 minutes to talk about stuff that came up during the week.\\n- I welcome you to take the time to plan (multiple) office hours with me (every Monday), even if it\\'s to talk about nothing. If you feel like we don\\'t talk enough, we don\\'t talk enough. I\\'d love you to help us fix that.\\n- For 1:1\\'s: maintain a Google Doc that we collaborate on. It helps us to follow up.\\n- Group meetings\\n- I love it when most time is spent around discussing concrete proposals. Vague points on the agenda (like \"discuss salary of X\") often feel like a waste of time.\\n- Be engaged, don\\'t multi-task.\\n- Let the group know if you\\'re losing your energy. Just say it. We might need to change something to the structure or contents of the meeting. I welcome this change.  \\n**My character**  \\n- I have character traits that have upsides and downsides. Here are some of them:\\n- **I\\'m a very, very curious person**. I\\'m interested in ideas and abstract concepts. I enjoy being confronted with novel information, even when it is complex.\\n- **I tend to read idea-centered books** (almost always non-fiction). I\\'m quite articulate and can formulate ideas clearly and quickly.\\n- **I\\'m very optimistic about the future.**\\n- **I\\'m a risk taker**. Career accomplishment is not my primary goal, I don\\'t care for safety and security.\\n- **I\\'m very extravert**. I\\'m very enthusiastic, talkative, assertive in social situations. I\\'m highly energized by social contact. Love talking on a stage.\\n- **I\\'m stubborn, dominant, harsh, skeptical and competitive**. At the same time I\\'m straightforward and blunt (so you know where I stand).\\n- **I don\\'t avoid discussions. On the contrary**. I will happily sacrifice peace and harmony to make a point or to get things done. (Being a soft, patient, eternally-listening ear doesn\\'t come as naturally. But I can do both.)\\n- **I often change opinion**. This might be really annoying to you, but I\\'m very consequent in the underlying ideas. (If you feel like I\\'m changing my opinions, try to digg deeper until you get to the underlying principles.)\\n- **I\\'m not very flexible, gentle or patient**. I can seem extremely demanding. When it annoys you, let me know. I appreciate it and I will try to tone it down. It\\'s not always conscious.\\n- **I\\'m skeptical**. It sometimes interferes with my ability to cooperate with others whose intentions are genuinely good. It also means that I can only function high in the hierarchy of power.\\n- **I\\'m not very good at voicing and truly understanding my own emotions**. Although it\\'s hard to guess what I\\'m thinking; I don\\'t have feelings of resentment. I don\\'t harbour hidden anger. If I\\'m angry, I\\'ll tell you.\\n- **I\\'m very assertive**. I can\\'t help it to take charge in situations without clear leadership.\\n- **I\\'m not disturbed by mess, disorder and chaos**. I simply don\\'t notice such things (and often don\\'t care). My schedules are loose, my time often unscheduled and I don\\'t care for routine and predictability. But, often my job requires it. It doesn\\'t come naturally though, and the only way to make it work for me is to live by my calendar. At the same time, when I take the time to be creative, I\\'m very welcoming of the chaos that accompanies creative endeavor. Also, I\\'m very good at it: **I know I\\'m productive when I spend time being creative.**\\n- **I\\'m, unfortunately, not very polite.**  \\n**My drive**  \\n- I have two goals in life. I want to be a great father and partner. And I want to make good information more accessible for more people. I know that last thing might sound super weird. But this is my professional purpose in life.\\n- I\\'m driven by being intellectually challenged, a feeling of purpose and creativity. I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and daughter a lot. I enjoy spending time at Blendle with my colleagues. At the same time, I love spending time alone. Reading or just fucking around with my computer (probably being on Reddit, Twitter or YouTube).  \\n**How to deal with me**  \\n- I\\'m extremely passionate about our mission. I might come off as combative because I will disagree and agree with you forcefully. Just in case it rubs you in the wrong way (which inevitably will happen), here are some possible expanations. Not all have to do with you.\\n- A) I genuinely enjoy discussions. Even when things get heated. It is the way I form opinions and ideas. That\\'s why I don\\'t take disagreements personal -- I merely see it as a way to evolve ideas and opinions. It\\'s a positive for me if a heated discussion led to a change in one of us.\\n- B) You did something that I felt lacks the right priorities, was poorly constructed, imcomplete, inadequate or otherwise didn\\'t meet my expectations. We all have triggers that cause us to look unfavorably on other people and these are mine:\\n- You\\'re coming to me with problems without thinking of proposals of how to fix it.\\n- You aren’t connecting your work to\\xa0impact\\xa0on your OKRs. I love when you can exist at 10,000 and 10 feet and clearly organize your priorities. Don’t waste time on things that don’t matter.\\n- You\\'re not spending enough time thinking strategically. If you\\'re too much in execution mode I\\'ll get very frustrated.\\n- You aren’t showing enough\\xa0rigor. I love it when you intensely evaluate the evidence, integrate that information from a wide range of sources, and apply sound judgment to make solid, smart decisions rapidly.\\n- You are shirking responsibility and not acting like an\\xa0owner. Be an agent for the change you want to make at this company and show fearlessness. It’s ok to fail and take calculated risks. Speak your mind when something is broken and pair it with clever solutions.\\n- You aren’t fostering\\xa0collaboration\\xa0and a positive, energetic environment. Know your strengths and weaknesses, understand different social styles, and show empathy, compassion and humanity.\\n- You aren’t engaging in your own learning and teaching. A thread that binds us together is\\xa0curiosity\\xa0— about our industry, business, customers, function, and perhaps most importantly, about ourselves.\\n- C) If I notice that you haven\\'t met my expectations, I will share my observation of your action. I\\'ll either do this immediately (if there is nobody else in the room) or during our next 1:1. Feel free to check with me if I\\'m frustrated by your actions, sometimes I\\'m not aware of my own frustration and it helps us both to check.\\n- D) If you\\'re sensing a lot of frustration from me, it\\'s highly probable that parts of (B) happened multiple times. We should try to resolve by doing (C). You are in this position because you are highly capable and talented, but if the situation stays like this, we\\'re just not a good match.\\n- E) I\\'m not listening well. Maybe because I\\'m stressed, frustrated or scared about something unrelated to you. I may realize later and will apologize, particularly if you email me what you were saying. I might reply that I was the dummy and apologize. I respect you calling me out on this.  \\n**The way I work**  \\n- I\\'m a hard worker. But I\\'m also very lazy. I like to do things in the minimal amount of time necessary. I have a low tolerance for chores and repetitive tasks.\\n- I\\'m quite likely to procrastinate things that I don\\'t like to do or are very complex.\\n- I can focus on the task at hand when there are high levels of motivation, but often find myself distracted by something more entertaining, interesting or worrisome.\\n- There\\'s a good chance I\\'m late, even if there isn\\'t much of a reason for it. I tend to find and deliver excuses for my failure under such circumstances.\\n- I don\\'t feel compelled to do things by the book. I love to engage in creative tasks, where rules must be broken for advancement to take place.\\n- I\\'m trying to split my time at work in 2 parts: contact with others and deep thinking. I need both in equal amounts to feel (and be) productive.\\n- I have the tendency to fix problems quickly and harshly. I immediately go into problem fixing mode, even while people might just want a listening ear.\\n- When I\\'m unsure of something, I\\'ll arrange people around me with opposing ideas. After the debate(s) I can make a decision.  \\n**First 6 months**  \\n- Ask plenty of questions. If you stop asking questions, I will see that as a red flag.\\n- It\\'s really helpful if you\\'re proactive with your learning goals. I will help you with this. It\\'s a lot of fun when we reach a point where information flows freely back and forth.\\n- I appreciate it if you share what you\\'re learning and what you still have to learn. Share your a-ha moments and outstanding questions.\\n- It\\'s impossible to over-communicate. Do not assume I know what you\\'re up to. If you\\'re ever debating including me on a communication, do it.  \\n**Feedback and celebrating success**  \\n- Celebrating things is not part of my DNA. I\\'m not likely to celebrate things that go well, or reward good behavior. I don\\'t hand out compliments easily. I know this is tough for some people, and I\\'m trying to get better at it.\\n- I also don\\'t give others a lot of feedback spontaniously. Another thing I\\'m trying to get better at.\\n- I value feedback enormously. I value it in a one scentence email when I said something stupid or nice. I value it when you put a lot of time in it and give it to me in a more elaborate manner.\\n- I value feedback from everyone at the company, but I\\'m also aware that I don\\'t come across as somebody with a lot of patience. Yet, I still hope you will give me feedback.  \\n**Stress**  \\n- I don\\'t understand my own stress well. It\\'s only after a stresful period that I can feel my body and mind being tired. I\\'m coming to better understand this by talking about it a lot. What I do know:\\n- When I don\\'t have options and have painted myself in a corner, I get very restless and stressed.\\n- I have days where I\\'m quite depressed and rather not want to get out of bed. This is correlated with my stress levels. At those days I\\'m feeling unhappy, anxious and irritable. I\\'m quite good at keeping my head in a storm, but when I\\'m stressed it costs me a lot of energy.\\n- I handle new, uncertain, unexpected, threatening or complex situations well. I don\\'t withdraw in the face of the unknown. Except when I\\'m stressed.  \\nPlease let me know when you feel like I\\'ve missed things. There\\'s a chance you know me better than I do :). # When is there too much stress?  \\nA burnout is referred to as a **‘death by a thousand cuts’**. So there is never one thing that will push you over the edge. It’s always a combination. A cocktail.  \\nLet’s start with a few quotes from people who had a burnout. This might not resonate with you directly because you may not feel like this. But this is to give you a grasp of how it feels when it’s been too much.  \\n> “It’s not just having too much to do, it’s having committed to doing more than you know you have time for. It’s committing to things you know at the time you won’t be able to get to, but another voice in your head says, ‘I’ll make it work somehow.’”\\n>  \\n> “Different people manifest burnout in different ways, but I think for all of us, it’s some variety of a shutdown,” she says. Parts of your personality start to contract. Your range of expression shrinks. Your world view narrows.”\\n>  \\n[Practical Frameworks for Beating Burnout](http://firstround.com/review/practical-frameworks-for-beating-burnout/)  \\n> “Suddenly without direction, I started feeling more and more disconnected. My work was no longer motivating, and it became harder and harder to stay focused. I felt like I was failing – like I should be able to make things work, but for some reason, I couldn’t.”\\n>  \\n> “I wasn’t overworked, but I was exhausted all the time. I couldn’t concentrate on my work – even simple tasks like responding to emails felt monumental. I was only able to work at a mere fraction of what I knew I was capable of. Things that used to be easy were almost impossible. I was plagued with insomnia, and found myself forgetting meals. My creativity had vanished – I could barely even respond to emails, let alone design a product.”\\n>  \\n> “Joyful activities, like playing with my infant daughter, suddenly felt like an obligation and a chore.”\\n>  \\n[Recovering from Burnout](https://kierantie.com/a/burnout/)  \\nSo I hope this helps you grasp how you might feel when it’s already too much. If you feel like ‘omg this is me’, that is a red flag…  \\nAfter a lot of reading and talking to people, I made a list of red flags that kept popping up:  \\n**Symptoms you can look for by yourself** (this is really different for everybody and therefore not list you can cross off)  \\n- It’s hard to concentrate over a longer period of time\\n- Irritated and agitated (easily)\\n- Emotional (more than normal, often on moments you don’t expect it)\\n- Trouble sleeping (falling asleep but also sleeping through)\\n- It’s hard to put things in perspective (it’s all big, heavy and important)\\n- Low energy and not in the mood to do stuff (you would normally do)\\n- You don’t enjoy things (starting with your work, but even your food might taste bad)\\n- Depressing and anxious thoughts\\n- Physical manifestations of stress: palpitations, hyperventilation, headaches, constipation\\n- Trouble remembering stuff (you forget things more than usual)\\n- Compulsive behaviour increases (addictions and ticks)  \\n**In your job you could look at the following:**  \\n- **Work-life balance:** not working too much and really ‘tuning out’ when not working (no slack, mail or even Twitter with colleagues). Spending time with loved ones, investing in personal relationships and hobbies. Read more about why this is so important:  \\n[Diversify Your Identity](https://markmanson.net/diversify-your-identity)  \\n- **Being happy with (believing in)** the direction the company is going. Do not underestimate how this effects you. Try speaking up if you feel like you are disconnected to the overall goals, beliefs, direction, mission and vision. Especially because it changes all the time.\\n- After being ‘on your toes’ for a while, you have **time to recover.** Not having the ‘it’s never done or good enough’ feeling.\\n- **Good relationships** with colleagues and team lead: having the feeling you can speak up and share doubts and/or troubles.\\n- **Influence and freedom** in the work you do.\\n- Feel that **your work matters** and has **impact**.\\n- Working in **a role that fits** you (doing work you like and you are good at and work on things you love).  \\nThis is just an outline and it isn’t meant to be complete. We have a lot of different characters at Blendle, but we do attract a certain type of person. This person usually has a big feeling of responsibility and a big drive and ambition. This type of person in particular is vulnerable to stress:  \\n> “In a way it’s ironic that this problem plagues Type-A players the most. The people who want to do their best and accomplish the most end up limiting themselves unintentionally. In startup culture, this usually manifests in people trying to have peak performance at work while also going to all the social events and being great to their families at the same time. Then they’re hard on themselves for not getting perfect marks in every category. As soon as they meet their own bar, they raise it.”\\n>  \\n[Practical Frameworks for Beating Burnout](http://firstround.com/review/practical-frameworks-for-beating-burnout/)  \\nAlright, so here we are: we now know we have a potentially dangerous environment (startup, fast paced, a lot of changes, a lot of freedom, not always clear structure) and we attract certain type of people: responsible, perfectionist, driven, ambitious and hard on themselves.', metadata={'Header 1': 'Work at Blendle'}),\n",
